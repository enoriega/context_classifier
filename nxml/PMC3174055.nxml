This suggests drugs targeting PI3K, and p110&#x003b1; in particular, might be useful in treating cancers. Broad-spectrum inhibition of PI3K is effective in preventing growth factor signalling and tumour growth, but suitable inhibitors of p110&#x003b1; have not been available to study the effects of inhibiting this isoform alone. In the present study we characterize a novel small molecule, A66, showing the <italic>S</italic>-enantiomer to be a highly specific and selective p110&#x003b1; inhibitor. Using molecular modelling and biochemical studies, we explain the basis of this selectivity. Using a panel of isoform-selective inhibitors, we show that insulin signalling to Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) is attenuated by the additive effects of inhibiting p110&#x003b1;/p110&#x003b2;/p110&#x003b4; in all cell lines tested. However, inhibition of p110&#x003b1; alone was sufficient to block insulin signalling to Akt/PKB in certain cell lines. The responsive cell lines all harboured H1047R mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and have high levels of p110&#x003b1; and class-Ia PI3K activity. This may explain the increased sensitivity of these cells to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors. We assessed the activation of Akt/PKB and tumour growth in xenograft models and found that tumours derived from two of the responsive cell lines were also responsive to A66 <italic>in vivo</italic>. These results show that inhibition of p110&#x003b1; alone has the potential to block growth factor signalling and reduce growth in a subset of tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>p110&#x003b1; E545K mutation</kwd><kwd>pan-phosphoinositide 3kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor NVP-BEZ235; phosphoinositide 3-kinase &#x003b1; (PI3K&#x003b1;)</kwd><kwd>phosphoinositide 4-kinase (PI4K)</kwd><kwd><italic>PIK3CA</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>PIK3CA</italic> H1047R mutation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>BID, twice daily dosing</kwd><kwd>ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase</kwd><kwd>mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin</kwd><kwd>PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase</kwd><kwd>PI4K, phosphoinositide 4-kinase</kwd><kwd>PKB, protein kinase B</kwd><kwd>PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10</kwd><kwd>QD, once daily dosing</kwd><kwd>TGI, tumour growth inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="55"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The three class-Ia PI3Ks (phosphoinositide 3-kinases; p110&#x003b1;/p110&#x003b2;/p110&#x003b4;) and the sole class-Ib PI3K (p110&#x003b3;) couple growth factor receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors to a wide range of downstream pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. These enzymes have different tissue distributions, difference in methods of activation and different kinetic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but they all use PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> to produce PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub>. The cellular levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> are tightly controlled by phosphatases, including PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) which dephosphorylates PtdIns(3,4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>3</sub> back to PtdIns(4,5)<italic>P</italic><sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The importance of this pathway in cancer is highlighted by the fact that defects in both the kinase and phosphatase activities are commonly observed in tumours. PTEN is a tumour suppressor gene whose function is commonly lost in tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], whereas the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene, which codes for p110&#x003b1;, appears to be the most important form of PI3K involved in solid tumours as it is commonly mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] or amplified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] in such cancers. The mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mainly occur in two distinct regions of the gene. It is not fully understood how these mutations contribute to the development of tumours, but they do confer a modest increase in catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], are capable of inducing transformation of cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and are capable of inducing tumours <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, evidence is emerging that the main two different hot spot mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> represent functionally distinct oncogenic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The full implications of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene amplification are not fully understood, but presumably act by increasing overall PI3K activity levels.</p><p>The identification of oncogenic mutations and amplifications in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> has spurred the development of a wide range of small molecule inhibitors targeting PI3K, with many of these currently in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Most of the compounds developed to date target multiple PI3K isoforms and related kinases such as mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Compounds in this class show efficacy in inhibiting growth of cells in culture and xenograft models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, a question that remains to be answered is whether selectively targeting p110&#x003b1; might achieve similar results given that this seems to be the predominant oncogenic form of class-I PI3Ks.</p><p>The potential importance of targeting p110&#x003b1; is shown by studies showing specific genetic knockdown of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> does block cell signalling and cell growth in a range of tumour lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To date the lack of suitable small-molecule inhibitors has meant that it has not been possible to properly evaluate whether pharmacological inhibition of p110&#x003b1; can achieve similar effects. Only one series of small molecules has been described that has a high degree of selectivity for p110&#x003b1; compared with other PI3K isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. One member of this family, PIK-75, has been used to study the role of p110&#x003b1;, but was found to have significant off-target activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], meaning it is difficult to know whether any actions of this drug are in fact due to its activity against PI3K. Despite these limitations, this drug has been used in some studies to infer that blocking p110&#x003b1; is sufficient to block signalling to Akt/PKB (protein kinase B) in some cell types but not others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, compounds related to PIK-75 have shown antitumour activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, hinting that p110&#x003b1; inhibition might be a useful therapeutic strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However these findings cannot be confirmed until a suitably clean p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitor is available.</p><p>In the present paper, we report the properties of A66, a compound that was recently found to be a potent p110&#x003b1; inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We show that this compound is highly selective for p110&#x003b1; over other PI3Ks and has a high degree of specificity as it does not target other protein kinases tested. We use this to demonstrate that inhibition of p110&#x003b1; attenuates signalling in a subset of cell types that are characterized by having kinase domain mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, high p110&#x003b1; levels and high total class-1a PI3K activity. We go on to show that A66 has efficacy in retarding growth of tumours in <italic>in vivo</italic> xenograft models that use cell lines that were responsive in culture. These results show that inhibition of p110&#x003b1; alone has the potential to block growth factor signalling and reduce growth in a subset of tumours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Inhbitors</title><p>The <italic>S</italic>-enantiomer of A66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) was prepared as described in Patent WO 2009/080705 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], except that 2-(tert-butyl)-4&#x02032;-methyl-[4,5&#x02032;-bithiazol]-2&#x02032;-amine was converted into A66 in one-pot by addition of <sc>L</sc>-prolinamide directly to the intermediate imidazolide solution.

Minimization was performed using 1000 steps of step descents followed by conjugate gradients until convergence at the 0.05 kcal/(mol&#x000b7;A) level. A distance-dependent dielectric function was used with a dielectric constant of 80. The major tautomer at pH&#x000a0;7.4 was generated using ChemAxon software. Docking was performed using GOLDv5.0. The apo p110&#x003b1; structure (PDB code 2RD0) was prepared by stripping all water molecules and the addition of protons using SYBYL8.2, and side-chain orientations were modified according to the results of MolProbity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The docking site was defined as an 18 &#x000c5; (1 &#x000c5;=0.1&#x000a0;nm) cavity centred on the Ile<sup>800</sup> CD1 atom. The Chemscore fitness function with kinase modification was used as the scoring function and 20 Genetic Algorithm runs were performed using a search efficiency of 200% with all poses were kept. Atom types for both protein and ligand were generated automatically and all ligand flexibility terms were turned on, although Ring-NH<sub>2</sub> and Ring-NR1R2 were set to flip, other settings were kept at default.

Age-matched specific pathogen-free male CD-1 mice were administered a single dose of A66 (10&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight) in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin in water or BEZ-235 in 15% (v/v) DMSO, 20% (v/v) 0.1&#x000a0;M HCl, 0.7% Tween 20 and 64.3% (v/v) saline. Mice were killed at five or six time points after dosing (<italic>n</italic>=3/time point) and blood was removed by cardiac puncture into EDTA collection tubes (Becton Dickinson). Blood samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 6000&#x000a0;rev./min at 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and the plasma supernatant was retained. Methanol was added to the plasma for protein extraction. Quantitative analysis was performed on an Agilent 6460 triple quadrupole LC-MS/MS (tandem MS) (Agilent Technologies) using multiple reaction monitoring and electrospray ionization. For chromatographic separation, an Agilent Zorbax SB-C<sub>18</sub> column (2.1&#x000a0;mm&#x000d7;50&#x000a0;mm; 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) was used with a mobile phase gradient of 20&#x02013;100% methanol in 0.1% formic acid and 5&#x000a0;mM ammonium formate at a flow rate of 0.4&#x000a0;ml/min. Plasma drug concentrations were quantified against a calibration curve of known drug concentrations ranging from 10 to 10000&#x000a0;nM, with quality controls included at 65, 650 and 6500&#x000a0;nM.

Tumour diameter as measured by electronic calipers was used to calculate tumour volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) based on the formula (<italic>L</italic>&#x000d7;<italic>w</italic><sup>2</sup>)&#x000d7;&#x003c0;/6 (where <italic>L</italic>=longest tumour diameter and <italic>w</italic>=perpendicular diameter). A66 was administered in 20% 2-hydroxypropyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich) in water, whereas BEZ-235 was administered in 10% ethanol. Control mice were administered the A66 dosing vehicle alone. The drugs were dosed by intraperitoneal injection as the free base equivalent at a dosing volume of 10&#x000a0;ml/kg of body weight. For tumour pharmacodynamic studies, mice were administered a single dose of A66 or the control vehicle when tumours reached approximately 8&#x02013;9&#x000a0;mm in diameter. Animals were killed 1 or 6&#x000a0;h after dosing and the tumours were removed, biopulverized and assayed for protein concentration (BCA protein assay; Sigma&#x02013;Aldrich). For antitumour efficacy studies, dosing began when tumours were well established, averaging approximately 7&#x000a0;mm in diameter. Doses were administered once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) with injections separated by a minimum of approximately 8&#x000a0;h. Different dosing schedules were used for the three xenograft models depending on the rate of tumour growth and the body weight tolerance of control mice. Animals were dosed daily for 21&#x000a0;days or twice daily for 16&#x000a0;days (SK-OV-3), daily for 14&#x000a0;days (U87MG) and daily for 7&#x000a0;days (HCT-116). Animals were monitored daily for any signs of emerging toxicity and body weight was recorded. Mice were killed if they developed moderate signs of toxicity or if body weight loss exceeded 20% of starting weight. TGI (tumour growth inhibition) was calculated on the final day of dosing by determining the relative tumour size of drug-treated mice as a percentage of the average relative tumour size of control mice. The statistical significance of TGI values was determined by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparison analysis using GraphPad Prism 5.02.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Inhibitor specificity</title><p>We first characterized A66 and confirmed it was a potent inhibitor of the wild-type and oncogenic forms of p110&#x003b1; but not other class-I PI3K isoforms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). We found A66 has a much greater degree of selectivity for p110&#x003b1; than PIK-75. Given the important roles of class-II PI3Ks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], class-III PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and PI4Ks (phosphoinositide 4-kinases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] in growth factor signalling, we also assessed the activity of A66 towards these and found some limited cross-reactivity with the class-II PI3K PI3K-C2&#x003b2; and the PI4K&#x003b2; isoform of PI4K (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). There was no inhibition of other lipid kinases or the related kinases DNA-PK and mTOR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). We also tested the inhibitory effects of 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M A66 effects on two large panels of 110 protein kinases (Supplementary Figure S1 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm</ext-link>) and 318 kinases (Supplementary Figure S2 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm</ext-link>). These show A66 is a very specific inhibitor of p110&#x003b1;, whereas PIK-75, the compound described previously as a p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitor, inhibited a large number of protein kinases at this concentration (Supplementary Figure S1). Our data for TGX-221 and IC87114 generated using the HTRF assay agreed with previous studies using other assay methods and confirmed these are highly selective inhibitors of p110&#x003b2; and p110&#x003b4; respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), although TGX-221 will cross-react with p110&#x003b4; at higher concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

The aminothiazole unit in A66 may also influence its interaction with p110&#x003b1; by binding similarly, this is in part supported by the inhibition of PI4K by both these compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The availability of the p110&#x003b1; X-ray crystal structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] allowed modelling of A66 in the p110&#x003b1; kinase domain and the likely mechanisms for its selectivity towards this compound were identified. The top-ranked binding mode for the A66 <italic>S</italic> form docked into the p110&#x003b1; ATP-binding site (PDB code 2RD0), after minimization and rescoring with the kinase modified Chemscore scoring function using receptor depth scaling, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Critically in this predicted binding mode, the ligand forms an interaction with Val<sup>851</sup> of the inter-lobe linker region. Both the backbone amide and carbonyl of Val<sup>851</sup> interact with the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor nitrogen atoms embedded in the central aminothiazole core, consistent with the binding mode observed for PIK-93 bound to p110&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The tertiary butyl-thiazole moiety extends from the amino-thioazole core into the lipophilic affinity pocket, whereas the pyrrolidine carboxamide group extends in the opposite direction towards a region of the binding site wall defined by the C-terminal lobe that contains p110&#x003b1;-specific residues, known to affect ligand binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In this predicted binding pose, the carboxamide amine moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the side-chain carbonyl group of Gln<sup>859</sup> and possibly the backbone carbonyl group of Ser<sup>854</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, the unminimized pose predicted a hydrogen bond interaction between both the carboxamide amide and carbonyl groups of the ligand and those in the Gln<sup>859</sup> side chain. These residues were predicted previously to be involved in inhibitor interactions in the p110&#x003b1; active site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Model of A66 <italic>S</italic> form in binding pocket of p110&#x003b1;</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="bic306i002"/></fig><p>We also investigated possible binding modes for the A66 <italic>R</italic> form, and observed that a pose similar to that of the S form was not found, and it failed to form a hydrogen bond interaction with the backbone amide of Val<sup>851</sup> as well. In the top ranked pose, the <italic>R</italic> pyrrolidine carboxamide amino group was predicted to form a hydrogen bond with the Val<sup>851</sup> backbone carbonyl. In this orientation, the ligand's central urea carbonyl was predicted to interact with the side-chain amino group of Gln<sup>859</sup> and also the affinity pocket was not occupied. Interestingly, a few clashes between the protein and ligand were observed with the <italic>S</italic> form, whereas more were present for that of the <italic>R</italic> form. These results, taken together along with the higher Chemscore fitness value (<italic>S</italic>, 17.46 compared with <italic>R</italic>, 13.26), indicate that the A66 <italic>S</italic> form appears to complement better the p110&#x003b1; active site. In agreement with this, we find that the A66 <italic>R</italic> form lost inhibitory activity and did not inhibit p110&#x003b1; at 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Superimposition of the p110&#x003b3; and p110&#x003b4; kinase domains on to that of p110&#x003b1; illustrates that in p110&#x003b3; Lys<sup>890</sup> replaces the p110&#x003b1; Gln<sup>859</sup>, whereas in p110&#x003b4; Asn<sup>836</sup> is the equivalent residue. As both these amino acid side-chains have hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups that may interact with the ligand's pyrrolidine carboxamide, A66 was docked into the p110&#x003b3; structure with the aminothiazole containing PIK-93 bound (PDB code 2CHZ) and the p110&#x003b4; apo enzyme structure (PDB code 2WXR). The top ranked pose predicted for A66 binding to p110&#x003b3; had a similar orientation to that predicted with p110&#x003b1;; however, the Chemscore fitness value was much lower, indicating a worse fit (Chemscore 7.29 compared with 17.46). An interaction with the p110&#x003b3; Val<sup>882</sup> backbone amide (the equivalent residue to p110&#x003b1; Val<sup>851</sup>) was also not predicted, even though the PIK-93 aminothiazole forms this interaction. No interaction was observed with Lys<sup>890</sup> and, moreover, the pyrrolidine group clashed with Trp<sup>812</sup> on the N-terminal lobe wall of the active site, further supporting poor complementarity of this compound with p110&#x003b3;. A low Chemscore value was also recorded for the top ranked pose in the p110&#x003b4; active site (8.44 compared with 17.46), indicating a poor fit in this isoform. In the present study, no pose was found that was similar to those predicted in either the p110&#x003b1; apo structure or p110&#x003b3; PIK93 structure, and an interaction with the backbone amide of the p110&#x003b1; Val<sup>851</sup> equivalent, Val<sup>828</sup>, was not observed. Neither was an interaction with Asn<sup>836</sup>. The lack of similarity between the binding mode predicted for p110&#x003b1; and those for p110&#x003b3; and p110&#x003b4; suggest that other active site features, more than residue substitutions at Gln<sup>859</sup>, may influence A66 binding. On the basis of the preferred binding model of A66 in p110&#x003b1;, we characterized the role of the carboxamide by docking an unsubstituted pyrrolidine derivative SN34552 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The binding mode was similar to that of A66, although the Chemscore was much lower in the absence of the predicted carboxamide-mediated hydrogen bonds (8.44 compared with 17.46), suggesting reduced potency. This was supported by biochemical data which showed that SN34452 has a much lower potency against p110&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and clearly indicates that the pyrrolindine carboxamide group makes p110&#x003b1;-specific contacts that are accessible in both the wild-type and oncogenic forms. Interestingly, SN34452 largely retains its potency against PI4K TypeIII&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which indicates the carboxamide is not critical for binding to this enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects of specifically inhibiting p110&#x003b1; on cell function</title><p>To investigate the role of p110&#x003b1; in regulating proximal elements of PI3K-dependent signalling pathways, we determined the ability of various concentrations of the A66 <italic>S</italic> form to acutely block the activation of Akt/PKB in a range of cell lines as assessed by both phosphorylation of Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Loading was controlled for by reprobing for total PKB (see Supplementary Figure S3 at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/438/bj4380053add.htm</ext-link>). We found that phosphorylation of both Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup> is sensitive to LY294002 in all cell lines tested, implying that class-I PI3K activity is required for activation of Akt/PKB. However, we found the amount of the A66 <italic>S</italic> form required to inhibit phosphorylation of Ser<sup>473</sup> and Thr<sup>308</sup> followed two distinct patterns, being either sensitive to inhibition by the A66 <italic>S</italic> form at concentrations consistent with it acting through p110&#x003b1; or being resistant. The most obvious feature of the sensitive cell lines was that they harboured H1047R mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, whereas all other cell lines were resistant.

The latter are likely to have characteristics more representative of real tumour tissue. In these studies we used PIK-75 as an alternative p110&#x003b1; inhibitor and we found that a low concentration of PIK-75 also blocks the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr<sup>308</sup> and Ser<sup>473</sup> on Akt/PKB in all lines harbouring <italic>PIK3CA</italic> H1047R mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A).

In other cells, the activation of Akt/PKB was not inhibited by TGX-221 or IC87114 at concentrations at which they would be specifically inhibiting p110&#x003b2; or p110&#x003b4; respectively.

First, we determined the optimal dosing strategy for xenograft studies by investigating the drug pharmacokinetics after a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg/kg of body weight by intraperitoneal injection in CD-1 mice. Despite a short half-life of only 0.42&#x000a0;h, the large <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (8247&#x000a0;nM) of A66 <italic>S</italic> that was reached 30&#x000a0;min after dosing ensured that the AUC<sub>0-inf</sub> (area under the curve from zero time to infinity) (6809&#x000a0;nM&#x000b7;h) was similar to that of BEZ-235 (7333&#x000a0;nM&#x000b7;h), which has a longer half-life of 2.73&#x000a0;h (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

The contacts made by the carboxamide group give A66 <italic>S</italic> its potency and selectivity for p110&#x003b1; but, interestingly, it does inhibit PI4K III&#x003b2; at concentrations approximately one order of magnitude higher. This is not surprising given the degree of homology between these enzymes in the catalytic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, SN34452 retains this activity against PI4K III&#x003b2; when the carboxamide is removed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>), which makes this one of the more selective PI4K III&#x003b2; inhibitors described to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The other is PIK-93, which is structurally quite different from A66 apart from sharing an amino thiazole core, but it also inhibits both p110&#x003b1; and PI4K III&#x003b2;, again highlighting the similarities in the catalytic site of these two enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Our results confirm previous studies that highlight the limitations of using PIK-75 and related compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, PIK-75 can still play a useful role as a backup for confirmatory experiments and it is worth noting that PIK-75 complements A66 in that it does not inhibit the two non-p110&#x003b1; lipid kinases that A66 targets, i.e. PI4K III&#x003b2; and PI3K-C2&#x003b2;. Our studies also add extra weight to the case for TGX-221 and IC87114 being considered as highly selective inhibitors of p110&#x003b2; and p110&#x003b4; if used at suitable concentrations.</p><p>The finding that A66 <italic>S</italic> potently blocks phosphorylation of Akt/PKB in a subgroup of the cell lines tested demonstrates that some cell types are highly dependent on p110&#x003b1; activity. This is consistent with genetic studies which show that knockdown of p110&#x003b1; blocked signalling to Akt/PKB in cell lines harbouring mutations in PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It also supports previous studies using PIK-75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and A66 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and suggests at least some cell types are more sensitive to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors. The finding that TGX-221 and IC87114 alone do not inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt/PKB at Ser<sup>473</sup> or Thr<sup>308</sup> in any of the cell lines tested, with the exception of a partial effect of TGX-221 in MCF7 cells, indicates that this pathway is not reliant on the catalytic activities of p110&#x003b2; and p110&#x003b4; in most cells. The findings with regard to p110&#x003b4; are not unexpected, but the findings with TGX-221 are somewhat at odds with some previous studies. Although no oncogenic mutations have been found in p110&#x003b2;, overexpression of p110&#x003b2; is capable of inducing transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Knockdown of <italic>PIK3CB</italic> has been shown to block the ability of PTEN-deficient cell lines to form foci in <italic>in vitro</italic> transformation assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and in <italic>in vivo</italic> tumour models. The knockdown of <italic>PIK3CB</italic> has also been reported to result in a small reduction in Akt/PKB phosphorylation in PTEN-deficient cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Although some functions of p110&#x003b2; appear to be independent of its lipid kinase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], the finding that TGX-221 blocks signalling to Akt/PKB in PTEN-deficient cells has been taken as evidence that the catalytic activity of p110&#x003b2; is required in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. However, it should be pointed out that those studies used a 20- to 100-fold higher concentration of TGX-221 than those used in the present study, which would provide for a significant opportunity for cross-reactivity with other PI3K isoforms. In support of this, Wee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] found that 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M TGX-221 was required to induce reduction in Akt/PKB activation in PTEN-deficient cell lines, but that at these concentrations also partially reduced activation of Akt/PKB in the DLD1 cell line that harbours a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation. This would be consistent with our results from the present study which demonstrate that binary combinations of A66 <italic>S</italic>, TGX-221 and IC87114 induce varying degrees of partial inhibition of activation of Akt/PKB, whereas the combination of all three drugs induced maximal inhibition. This indicates that the three class-Ia PI3K isoforms are functionally redundant to some extent and can substitute each other in signalling to Akt/PKB in these PTEN-null cells, as has been observed previously in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, activation of Akt/PKB was sensitive to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors in H1047R cells but not in PTEN-null cell lines and those harbouring E545K mutations, which is in agreement with the studies of Torbett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] who used PIK-75. It would be tempting to conclude that the sensitivity to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors is a direct consequence of the presence of the H1047R mutation, since this isoform has increased catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutants are not intrinsically sensitive to A66 or PIK-75 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and gene knockout studies have shown that sensitivity of HCT-116 cells to p110&#x003b1;-selective PIK-75 analogues is not changed by deletion of the H1047R allele of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Furthermore, the study by Torbett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed that MCF10A cells and Hs578t cells were also sensitive to PIK-75. The latter can be explained by the fact that this line was subsequently found to have a mutation in <italic>PIK3R1</italic> (Cosmic database) and such mutations have been shown to be sensitive to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Although MCF10A cells have no reported mutations in PI3K signalling pathways, a certain sub-population of these cells has been reported to have high PI3K activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. This is consistent with another study which observed PI3K is not mutated in medulloblastoma, but that p110&#x003b1; is overexpressed and that such cells are very sensitive to PIK-75 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, we have observed previously in other cells that the degree of PIK-75 sensitivity is proportional to the relative amount of the total PI3K activity that is attributable to p110&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Our results from the present study also show that the cells with high overall class-Ia PI3K and p110&#x003b1; protein levels are the ones that are sensitive to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors. Therefore the increased catalytic activity of the H1047 mutant may not be sufficient on its own to confer sensitivity to p110&#x003b1; inhibitors, but rather it may be the total levels of p110&#x003b1; (mutant or wild-type) in the cells that is most important. In this regard it is worth noting that evidence has recently been presented to indicate that at least part of the effect of the H1047R mutant might be to stabilize p110&#x003b1; levels in the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The relative levels of class-Ia PI3K isoforms is also likely to be important and it is in this regard it is noteworthy that MCF7 cells are partially responsive to TGX-221, suggesting a dependence on p110&#x003b2;, and this cell line is the only one where we found high p110&#x003b2; and low p110&#x003b1; levels. Further studies will be required to clarify these issues.</p><p>The reason for the difference in characteristics between the H1047R and E545K cell lines is not clear. However, a number of studies have indicated that these two main oncogenic forms of p110&#x003b1; are likely to function differently <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In particular, the helical domain mutants appear to signal independently of the p85 adapter subunit, and hence of activation by receptor tyrosine kinases, but require Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. The kinase domain mutants, on the other hand, require p85 but are independent of Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Again it will require further studies to clarify this issue.</p><p>The finding that A66 <italic>S</italic> is more effective at inducing growth delay in the HCT-116 and SK-OV-3 xenograft models than the pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] demonstrates that a p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitor can be effective at slowing cell growth in the absence of mTOR inhibition in certain cell types. In addition, although A66 <italic>S</italic> did not induce tumour regression in xenograft models, the ability to induce growth delay indicates p110&#x003b1;-selective inhibitors have to ability to be effective as cytostatic agents in some tumour types. Further studies will be required to determine whether A66 might contribute to tumour regression as part of a combination drug treatment strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4380053add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Stephen Jamieson, Jack Flanagan, Bruce Baguley and Peter Shepherd developed concepts, and designed and supervised experiments.
