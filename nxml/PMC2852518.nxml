We searched for genes that have the potential to be therapeutic targets by identifying genes consistently over-expressed when amplified. Fifty-six TNBCs were subjected to high-resolution microarray-based comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH), of which 24 were subjected to genome-wide gene expression analysis. TNBCs were genetically heterogeneous; no individual focal amplification was present at high frequency, although 78.6% of TNBCs harboured at least one focal amplification. Integration of aCGH and expression data revealed 40 genes significantly overexpressed when amplified, including the known oncogenes and potential therapeutic targets, <italic>FGFR2</italic> (10q26.3), <italic>BUB3</italic> (10q26.3), <italic>RAB20</italic> (13q34), <italic>PKN1</italic> (19p13.12), and <italic>NOTCH3</italic> (19p13.12). We identified two TNBC cell lines with <italic>FGFR2</italic> amplification, which both had constitutive activation of FGFR2. Amplified cell lines were highly sensitive to FGFR inhibitor PD173074, and to RNAi silencing of <italic>FGFR2</italic>. Treatment with PD173074 induced apoptosis resulting partly from inhibition of PI3K-AKT signalling. Independent validation using publicly available aCGH datasets revealed <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene was amplified in 4% (6/165) of TNBC, but not in other subtypes (0/214, p=0.0065). Our analysis demonstrates that TNBCs are heterogeneous tumours with amplifications of FGFR2 in a subgroup of tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Triple negative breast cancer</kwd><kwd>microarrays</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>comparative genomic hybridisation</kwd><kwd>FGFR2</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="United Kingdom">Cancer Research UK : </funding-source><award-id>A10038 || CRUK_</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The identification of distinct subgroups of breast cancer has led to the development of therapeutic strategies that exploit the underlying biology of the subtype, with hormonal therapies and HER2 targeting agents for hormone receptor-positive and HER2-positive breast cancers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Reis-Filho and Tutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). Tumours lacking expression of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)) and HER2 (triple negative breast cancers, TNBCs), on the other hand, pose a significant clinical challenge due to a poor understanding of the genetic alternations that underlie the development of TNBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Reis-Filho and Tutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and this is reflected in a lack of subtype-specific targeted therapies.</p><p id="P3">TNBCs comprise a heterogeneous group of breast cancers and account for 10-15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Agrawal <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Carey <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dent <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Reis-Filho and Tutt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Schneider <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) of all invasive breast cancers. Histologically, the majority of TNBCs are grade III invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NST), although the majority of medullary, metaplastic and adenoid cystic carcinomas also display a triple negative phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Reis-Filho and Tutt, 2008</xref>). These tumours are more prevalent in young women (&#x0003c;50 years) and in women of African and Hispanic descent.

Similarly, women with TNBCs have a significantly shorter survival following recurrence when compared to those with non-triple negative cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Dent et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Harris et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the identification of novel therapeutic targets for TNBCs is important if the outcome of patients with these tumours is to be improved.</p><p id="P4">Based on the concept of oncogene addiction, we and others have demonstrated that genes that are consistently overexpressed when amplified may be selectively required for the survival of cancer cells harbouring their amplification, and can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Bernard-Pierrot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Natrajan et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Reis-Filho et al., 2006</xref>).

Our aims were to characterise the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of TNBCs and identify and validate genes that are recurrently amplified and consistently overexpressed when amplified in TNBCs. We found more frequent high level, focal amplifications than previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Chin et al., 2006</xref>), and identified potential therapeutic targets that are consistently overexpressed when amplified. We validated the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (<italic>FGFR2</italic>) gene as one of these targets and provided functional data to suggest that this tyrosine kinase receptor may be a novel therapeutic target in a subset of TNBCs harbouring <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene amplification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S2"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title>Tumour samples</title><p id="P6">Fifty-six fresh-frozen samples of TNBCs were obtained after approval by local Ethic Committees from the authors&#x02019; institutions.

We identified 324 genes whose mRNA expression levels were significantly higher in tumours harbouring DNA copy number gains and 39 genes whose mRNA expression levels were significantly lower in tumours displaying DNA copy number loss.

Using high resolution array CGH and gene expression platforms, tumours with &#x0003e;70% of neoplastic cells, and only invasive ductal cancers of no special type, we have demonstrated that a substantial proportion of genes have expression levels that significantly correlate with copy number in TN cancers. Functional annotation of these genes using IPA revealed that the canonical pathways of several tyrosine kinase receptors involved in tumourigenesis and cancer progression were enriched for the genes upregulated by copy number gain were enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11">Supplementary Table 8</xref>). Interestingly, copy number gains of the tyrosine kinase receptors were rare; instead, upregulation of signal transduction kinases downstream of the receptors (e.g. RAF1, PTK2, PIK3C2G, CSNK1D, MAPK9) and adaptor proteins (e.g., GRB2, GAB1) was observed. It is possible that these recurrent copy number gains, of multiple components of the canonical pathways of tyrosine kinase receptors, could create a permissive context for activation of these pathways in TN breast cancers. In addition this observation suggests that in TNBCs it may be possible to identify commonly activated signal transduction pathways that could be targeted effectively for TNBC therapy.</p><p id="P33">The majority of TNBCs showed losses on 1p, 2q, 3p, 4p, 5q, 8p 9q, 16q, 17p, 19p, and 23p; and gains on 1p, 3q, 6p, 9p, 7q, 8p, 10p, and 12p. Only 11% of the tumours in our cohort showed concurrent 1q gain and 16q loss, the typical changes of low-grade ER positive breast cancers, in agreement with our previous results suggesting that progression from grade I to grade III is an uncommon phenomenon in TNBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Natrajan et al., 2009a</xref>). It should be noted that many of the regions that were affected by genetic aberrations in TNBCs such as gain of 1q, 3q, 7q, 8q, and 10p and loss of 4p, 5q, 17p, and 8p, have also been found in tumours arising in <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Jonsson et al., 2005</xref>).

In fact, 76.8% of the tumours analysed in this study harboured at least one focal (&#x0003c;10Mb) amplification. However, the majority of these amplifications were shown to occur at low frequency, confirming that at the genomic level TNBCs are genomically heterogeneous. To develop therapeutic strategies directed at drivers of the recurrent amplicons in TNBC will be challenging, requiring comprehensive molecular pathology analyses of primary tumours to select the appropriate targeted therapy for the individual tumours. A novel approach to clinical trial design would also be required if rare oncogenic targets are to be validated. An alternative approach to the therapy of TNBCs would be to identify shared signal transduction pathways that could be targeted for tumour treatment without targeting the oncogene directly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>Supplementary Table 1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1036" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD10"><label>Supplementary Table 7</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-7.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1040" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD11"><label>Supplementary Table 8</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-8.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1044" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD12"><label>Supplementary Table 9</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-9.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1048" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>Supplementary Table 10</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-10.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1052" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><label>Supplementary Figure Legends, Methods</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-11.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1056" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><label>Supplementary Figures</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-12.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1060" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><label>Supplementary Table 2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1064" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD6"><label>Supplementary Table 3</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1068" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD7"><label>Supplementary Table 4</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1072" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD8"><label>Supplementary Table 5</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-5.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1077" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD9"><label>Supplementary Table 6</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS28236-supplement-6.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1081" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S23"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Cancer Research UK and Breakthrough Breast Cancer.
