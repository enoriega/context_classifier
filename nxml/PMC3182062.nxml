Although the major risk factors are known, therapeutic options in patients remain limited in part because of our incomplete understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms influencing HCC development. Evidence indicates that the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway is functionally inactivated in most cases of HCC by genetic, epigenetic, and/or viral mechanisms. To investigate the functional relevance of this observation, we inactivated the RB pathway in the liver of adult mice by deleting the three members of the <italic>Rb</italic> (<italic>Rb1</italic>) gene family: <italic>Rb</italic>, <italic>p107</italic>, and <italic>p130</italic>. <italic>Rb</italic> family triple knockout mice develop liver tumors with histopathological features and gene expression profiles similar to human HCC. In this mouse model, cancer initiation is associated with the specific expansion of populations of liver stem/progenitor cells, indicating that the RB pathway may prevent HCC development by maintaining the quiescence of adult liver progenitor cells. In addition, we show that during tumor progression, activation of the Notch pathway via E2F transcription factors serves as a negative feedback mechanism to slow HCC growth. The level of Notch activity is also able to predict survival of HCC patients, suggesting novel means to diagnose and treat HCC.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) results in &#x0003e;600,000 deaths per year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Caldwell and Park, 2009</xref>). Although the major risk factors have been identified, including infection with hepatitis viruses B or C, mechanisms that are at work during the development of HCC remain poorly understood, hindering the development of novel therapeutic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farazi and DePinho, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The extended retinoblastoma (RB) pathway is comprised of p16<sup>INK4a</sup> and p21<sup>CIP1</sup> family members, which inhibit the kinase activity of Cyclin&#x02013;Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes; these complexes in turn normally inactivate the RB protein and its two family members p107 and p130 by hyperphosphorylation during the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, thereby activating E2F transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkhart and Sage, 2008</xref>). Accumulating evidence suggests an almost universal inactivation of the RB pathway in HCC, including by promoter hypermethylation of the <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> (&#x0223c;50% of cases) or <italic>p15<sup>INK4b</sup></italic> (&#x0223c;15% of cases) genes, and amplification of the gene coding for Cyclin D1 (&#x0223c;30% of cases). Mutations in the <italic>RB</italic> gene itself are rare, but the RB protein is often undetected in HCC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edamoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laurent-Puig and Zucman-Rossi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Knudsen and Knudsen, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, Gankyrin, an E3 ligase that triggers degradation of RB family members, is overexpressed in the majority of HCC tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Higashitsuji et al., 2000</xref>). Finally, the RB pathway is also inactivated in liver cells by viral proteins: for example, hepatitis B virus infection results in the constitutive expression of viral proteins such as preS2 and HBx, which directly or indirectly activate Cyclin&#x02013;CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hsieh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2010b</xref>). Similarly, recruitment of the E6AP ubiquitin ligase by the hepatitis C virus protein NS5B leads to the degradation of RB and potentially p107 and p130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Munakata et al., 2007</xref>). These observations suggest a yet untested model in which overall inactivation of the RB pathway by simultaneous decreased function of the three RB family members may be necessary for HCC development. This idea is supported by the observation that deletion of the <italic>Rb</italic> (<italic>Rb1</italic>) gene in the mouse liver is not sufficient to drive HCC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Williams et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mayhew et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Many of the events resulting in the functional inactivation of the RB pathway in human HCC occur early in the course of the disease, suggesting that the RB pathway may play an important role in the prevention of HCC initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nordenstedt et al., 2010</xref>). However, identifying the cell type or types from which HCC may originate is not currently possible in patients. Mature hepatocytes (parenchymal cells) in the liver have the capacity to proliferate and could therefore serve as the cell of origin for HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oertel and Shafritz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benhamouche et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, the portal triad, a structure composed of a bile duct, a portal vein, and a hepatic artery, is thought to serve as a niche for several populations of stem and progenitor cells (nonparenchymal cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Susick et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmelzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). These progenitor cells, often termed oval cells, also have the capacity to expand in response to stress and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erker and Grompe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>). All of these different liver cell populations may serve as a cell of origin for HCC. Unfortunately, the current lack of a comprehensive knowledge of the different stages of differentiation in the hepatocytic lineage has hampered a thorough investigation of the cellular origin of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Thorgeirsson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mishra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to address the molecular and cellular mechanisms of HCC development upon loss of RB pathway function. We show that <italic>Rb</italic> family triple KO (TKO) mice, in which the RB pathway is genetically inactivated, develop liver cancer with histological and molecular similarities to human HCC. In addition, we show that loss of RB family function allows the expansion of normally quiescent populations of stem/progenitor cells, and we identify activation of Notch signaling as a suppressor feedback mechanism during HCC progression.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Genetic ablation of the <italic>Rb</italic> gene family in the liver of adult mice results in the development of tumors similar to human HCC</title><p>To model the functional inactivation of the RB pathway found in human HCC, we specifically deleted the three <italic>Rb</italic> family genes in the liver of adult mice by performing intrasplenic injection of adenovirus expressing the Cre recombinase (Ad-Cre) in conditional TKO (cTKO; <italic>Rb<sup>lox/lox</sup>;p130<sup>lox/lox</sup>;p107<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viatour et al., 2008</xref>) adult mice. In this protocol, the adenovirus predominantly delivers the Cre recombinase to hepatocytes as well as nonparenchymal cells in the liver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20110198/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). All of the Ad-Cre&#x02013;infected cTKO mice analyzed and none of the control mice infected with Ad-GFP developed multiple liver lesions after a latency of 3&#x02013;4 mo and had to be euthanized within 5&#x02013;8 mo because of tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>); these mice did not develop any other visible pathology outside the liver (not depicted). Quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis with RNA extracted from macro-dissected tumors showed decreased expression of <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>p130</italic>, confirming deletion of these two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The presence of one <italic>p130</italic> or <italic>p107</italic> allele was sufficient to prevent the development of liver tumors at the same time points (Fig. S1 B and not depicted). Cells in these lesions were actively cycling, as visualized by immunostaining for BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) and by immunoblot analysis for known markers of proliferation (Fig. S1 C). Finally, TKO liver tumors could be serially transplanted in immunocompromised mice, confirming their tumorigenic potential (Fig. S1, D&#x02013;F).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Genetic inactivation of the <italic>Rb</italic> gene family in the mouse liver results in HCC development.</bold> (A) One representative (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 20) TKO mouse with tumors (asterisks) in the liver is shown 4 mo after intrasplenic Ad-Cre injection.

Immunostaining experiments further indicated that TKO tumors were composed of cells expressing heterogeneous levels of Albumin (a hepatocyte marker) but undetectable levels of CK19 or EpCAM (cholangiocyte markers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 G</xref> and Fig. S1 G), similar to most human HCCs. To further assess the relevance of the TKO model to human HCC, we performed a microarray analysis comparing TKO tumors to human HCCs. A previous analysis of gene expression profiles from a large set of human HCCs identified six HCC subgroups (G1&#x02013;G6), each with different molecular features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyault et al., 2007</xref>). We found that TKO tumors clustered preferentially with the G1&#x02013;G3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Interestingly, some TKO tumors clustered with human G3 tumors, which are characterized in part by the expression of several genes implicated in cell cycle control, including E2F target genes, and by the methylation of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus, which codes for p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, an upstream regulator of the entire RB family. Together, these observations indicate that the tumors growing in the liver of TKO mice provide a novel model for human HCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Expansion of the stem/progenitor compartment upon deletion of <italic>Rb</italic> family genes in the liver of adult mice</title><p>The early stages of cancer initiation are challenging to study in HCC patients, who are often diagnosed with advanced disease, but are readily accessible to in vivo analysis in mouse models. We examined tumor development 1&#x02013;5 wk after Cre-mediated inactivation of <italic>Rb</italic> family genes in the liver of adult cTKO mice. At these time points, the mutant liver appeared macroscopically normal (not depicted), but liver sections showed the progressive appearance of foci of small cells growing next to the portal triad; these cells had a high nuclear/cytoplasm ratio and often displayed an oval shape as well as some histopathological features of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20110198/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Immunostaining for glutamine synthase (GS), a marker of centrilobular hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebhardt and Hovhannisyan, 2010</xref>), confirmed that the small lesions were growing next to portal triads, away from central veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The adult liver is a quiescent organ, and very few cells stained positive for the cell cycle marker Ki67 on liver sections from control mice 2&#x02013;4 wk after Ad-Cre infection (not depicted). In contrast, immunostaining for Ki67 on liver sections from TKO mice showed that cells in the small lesions were proliferative; strikingly, very little proliferation was observed in populations of mature hepatocytes surrounding the early lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>; see a second example in Fig. S2, C and E). Little, if any apoptotic cell death was observed by immunostaining for cleaved caspase 3 on sections from control and TKO mice at these early time points (not depicted). This analysis suggested that loss of RB family members in the liver of adult mice leads rapidly and specifically to the proliferation of progenitor-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roskams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorrell et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Inactivation of the <italic>Rb</italic> gene family in the adult liver results in the expansion of cells with features of stem/progenitor cells.</bold> (A) Representative H&#x00026;E staining (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003e; 20) of the liver of a cTKO mouse infected with Ad-Cre (4 wk after the injection) shows that TKO early liver lesions are composed of small cells.

However, we did not detect expression of these markers by immunostaining in the small lesions growing in the liver of TKO mice. The A6 antigen is also a marker of both liver progenitor cells and bile duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engelhardt et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haybaeck et al., 2009</xref>), and we found an expansion of A6<sup>+</sup> cells around the portal triad of cTKO mice 2&#x02013;3 wk after Cre induction (Fig. S2, F&#x02013;K). Several cells in the TKO lesions were also positive for Sox9, a recently identified marker of liver progenitors (Fig. S2, L&#x02013;N; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorrell et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, we used antibodies against Sca1, a marker expressed at the surface of mouse stem/progenitor cells in different tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holmes and Stanford, 2007</xref>), including in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clayton and Forbes, 2009</xref>), and found an expansion of Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells within the small lesions by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). A panel of antibodies that recognize specific surface epitopes on cells activated during an oval cell response initiated by DDC (3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine) treatment was recently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorrell et al., 2008</xref>). Among the nine monoclonal antibodies that we tested, only MIC1-1C3 (C3), OC2-3C7 (C7), and OC2-6E10 (E10) consistently stained TKO early lesions, albeit with variable frequency and intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and Fig. S2, O&#x02013;Q). The difference in signal intensity suggests that progenitor cells expanding in the DDC and TKO models are only partially overlapping, which is supported by the different histological structures developed in the two models (Fig. S2, R and S). Thus, cells expanding in the liver of TKO mice express markers that are characteristic of subpopulations of adult liver stem/progenitor cells, providing additional support to a model in which loss of RB family function leads to the expansion of populations of liver progenitor cells.</p><p>To control for reactive effects to the adenoviral infection in the liver, we used intraperitoneal injection of tamoxifen (Tam) in <italic>Rosa26<sup>CreER</sup></italic> cTKO mice to delete <italic>Rb</italic> and <italic>p130</italic>. In this model, the CreER fusion protein is broadly expressed and can be activated upon Tam injection to inactivate the RB family in multiple tissues and organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viatour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhart et al., 2010</xref>). We found that induction of Cre activity by Tam in this system was often more efficient than with Ad-Cre, as judged by the analysis of a YFP reporter (Fig. S2, T&#x02013;W); we also found an expansion of cells with progenitor cell markers in <italic>Rosa26<sup>CreER</sup></italic> TKO mice (Fig. S2 B and not depicted).

Interestingly, only a minor fraction of cells were double positive for Sca1 and C3/C7/E10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), indicating that these antigens marked distinct populations of cells.

When placed in culture, TKO nonparenchymal cells produced more colonies than nonparenchymal cells from control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Under these conditions, although control cells absolutely required epidermal growth factor (EGF) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) to form colonies, cells from TKO livers formed colonies in the absence of these growth factors, although not to the extent of cells with EGF and HGF. Nonparenchymal TKO cells were able to form lesions resembling the lesions growing in the liver of TKO mice when transplanted into the liver of immunodeficient mice (Fig. S3 C), but they failed to form tumors when transplanted under the skin (not depicted). This observation and the partial growth factor independence suggest that, at this early stage, TKO liver cells in the small lesions still require an appropriate microenvironment to expand. When we used flow cytometry to further identify the cells in the liver of TKO mice that had the ability to form colonies in culture, we found that Sca1/C3/C7/E10<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from TKO mice reproducibly failed to produce colonies under these conditions (unpublished data).

Potential changes in the Notch signaling pathway were also detected by GSEA. Although Notch signaling has been shown to play a critical role in cell fate decisions during liver development, little is known regarding its possible role in liver cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>). Changes in the expression of genes in the Notch pathway in TKO HCCs were supported by the presence of Notch pathway members in a cluster of genes that are specifically up-regulated in the TKO HCC model compared with other HCC mouse models; this cluster includes Notch receptors (<italic>Notch1&#x02013;4</italic>), as well as a downstream transcriptional target of the Notch pathway (<italic>Nrarp</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and E</xref>; and supplemental text; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pirot et al., 2004</xref>).

This increase in the transcription of several genes in the Notch pathway in <italic>Rb</italic> family mutant cells raised the possibility that it was a direct consequence of the activation of E2F transcription factors. Indeed, reporter gene assays showed that promoters of the mouse <italic>Hes1</italic> gene and the human <italic>NOTCH1</italic> gene could be activated by E2F1 and E2F3, two transactivating members of the E2F family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).

E2F binding to the promoter region of Notch pathway genes was also observed in WT mouse adult livers; in particular, we found increased binding of E2F4, a repressor E2F, to several of the promoters tested in these quiescent liver cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>), correlating with the lower transcription of Notch pathway genes in normal liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To determine whether this finding was specific to mouse cells, we performed similar experiments with the human HCC cell lines Hep3B and SNU-449 and found binding of E2F1, E2F3, and E2F4 to the same Notch pathway gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref> and not depicted).

To directly test whether activation of Notch signaling was sufficient to block the proliferation of HCC cells in a cell intrinsic manner, we overexpressed the constitutively active ICD of Notch1 in liver tumor cell lines derived either from TKO mice (TKO1 and TKO2) or from human HCC (C3a, SNU-449, and HepG2). We found that expression of Notch1 ICD was sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of three out of the four cell lines tested (TKO1, TKO2, and SNU-449 but not HepG2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref> and not depicted) and also induced an apoptotic response in four out of the five cell lines tested (TKO1, C3a, HepG2, and SNU-449 but not TKO2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 H</xref>). These findings indicate that activation of the Notch signaling pathway after activation of E2F in RB family mutant HCC cells serves as a negative feedback mechanism to slow the expansion of the tumor cells.</p><p>Activation of Notch signaling is critical for biliary differentiation of liver progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Geisler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hofmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roskams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Onoyama et al., 2011</xref>). This observation raised the question of the status of Notch signaling in the liver progenitor populations from which TKO HCCs may arise. RT-qPCR analysis from FACS-sorted Sca1<sup>+</sup> and C3/C7/E10<sup>+</sup> liver progenitor cells and hepatocytes showed that Notch1 signaling was significantly higher in progenitor cell populations compared with mature liver cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20110198/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). Immunostaining for HES1 and nuclear Notch1 confirmed the activation of the Notch pathway in early TKO lesions (Fig. S4). However, although the Notch pathway is transcriptionally activated in TKO hepatocytes compared with their controls, loss of the three RB family proteins did not further induce the expression of <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hey1</italic>, or <italic>Nrarp</italic> in TKO progenitors (Fig. S5 A). These findings suggest that transcriptional control of Notch pathway genes by RB family members is cell type dependent and evolves during tumor progression, being more apparent in cells with low Notch pathway activity. We found no differences in TKO progenitor cell numbers or in their cell cycle activity upon treatment with DAPT in vivo (Fig. S5, B&#x02013;D), possibly because high Notch activity in these cells renders them less sensitive to partial inhibition of the Notch pathway by DAPT. However, the colony-forming activity of TKO liver progenitor cells in culture was significantly impaired when these cells were sorted from mice and infected with a Notch1 ICD retrovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 I</xref>), similar to what we had observed with HCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 G</xref>). This observation suggests that hyperactivation of Notch signaling also inhibits the proliferation of liver progenitor cells.</p><p>To address the relevance of the findings that activation of Notch signaling may serve as a mechanism to dampen the proliferation of HCC cells to HCC patients, we took advantage of a dataset in which gene expression profiles are linked to patient survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). In this study, clustering analysis had led to the identification of two major HCC molecular groups, with group B patients showing a better survival than group A patients. We found that the TKO dataset preferentially clustered with human tumors of the B subgroup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 J</xref>), similar to what had been previously observed for tumors expressing Myc and E2F1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, the expression level of the human <italic>NOTCH1</italic> and <italic>HES1</italic> genes was significantly higher in group B versus group A (P &#x0003c; 0.05). However, removal of these Notch pathway genes from the analysis did not change the clustering of TKO tumors to group B (unpublished data), indicating that other genes or pathways may be involved in the enhanced survival of patients in group B. The analysis of recent genome-wide ChIP experiments indicates that RB may directly bind to the promoters of other genes in the Notch pathway such as <italic>JAG1</italic> and <italic>PSEN2</italic> in senescent fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chicas et al., 2010</xref>; unpublished data). These observations and our data in HCC cells led us to test the role of a broader Notch pathway signature in HCC. We found that a curated list of 17 genes used as a signature of the Notch pathway independently predicted increased survival in HCC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, J and K</xref>; and Fig. S5 E).

In fact, we found that the presence of one WT allele of <italic>p107</italic> or <italic>p130</italic> was sufficient to prevent HCC development for at least 6&#x02013;8 mo after Cre activation, similar to our observation in the hematopoietic compartment, indicating that reintroduction of one <italic>Rb</italic> family allele significantly impairs tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viatour et al., 2008</xref>). We cannot exclude the possibility that these mice will eventually develop HCC at later time points; indeed two of the cell lines that we have isolated thus far from TKO mice have retained a WT <italic>p130</italic> allele (unpublished data). Although it is difficult to directly compare the genetic deletion of <italic>Rb</italic> family genes in the mouse system to the protein inactivation by degradation or phosphorylation observed in human HCC, these results support the observation that most events targeting the RB pathway in HCC simultaneously inactivate the three RB family proteins (see introduction).</p><p>An important question in the liver cancer field is whether HCC initiates from hepatocytes and/or earlier progenitors in the adult liver, a question which is challenging to address in patients. Cre activation in cTKO mice results in the proliferation and rapid expansion of cells with characteristics of liver stem/progenitor cells, including their morphology, their localization close to the portal triad, and their expression of specific markers. At the same time point, we observed only limited DNA replication in mature hepatocytes and no evidence of clonal expansion. These observations, together with the fact that a fraction enriched for nonparenchymal progenitor cells can recapitulate tumor development upon transplantation, strongly suggest that TKO HCC tumors initiate from the stem/progenitor compartment in the liver of mice. The stem/progenitor cell hypothesis is supported by evidence that Cullin 3, a regulator of Cyclin E (an inhibitor of the RB family), prevents liver cancer development from liver progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kossatz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although EpCAM and CK19 have been proposed to mark some liver progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmelzer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>), immunostaining and FACS analysis (unpublished data) for these markers did not identify EpCAM<sup>+</sup> or CK19<sup>+</sup> cells in TKO early lesions. One interpretation of this observation is that TKO lesions initiate from progenitors that are distinct from EpCAM<sup>+</sup> or CK19<sup>+</sup> progenitors, which would underscore the heterogeneity of liver stem/progenitor cell populations. This idea is supported by the observation that progenitor cells expanding upon inactivation of the NF2 tumor suppressor display different characteristics than progenitor cells expanding in TKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benhamouche et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we found that some TKO liver progenitors are positive for markers that were originally developed in a model of DDC-induced liver progenitor expansion. However, the paucity of C3<sup>+</sup>, C7<sup>+</sup>, or E10<sup>+</sup> cells in TKO mice compared with DDC treatment (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> with Fig. S2, L&#x02013;N), as well as the lack of organized structure in TKO livers versus the formation of atypical bile ducts in the DDC model (Fig. S2, O and P) further suggest that the populations of progenitor cells involved in the expansion in the two models are not equivalent. Nevertheless, the observation that some cells in early TKO lesions express Sox9 indicates that there are some similarities between the two systems. Future experiments will continue to compare markers expressed by adult liver progenitor cells identified in different systems to better define distinct subpopulations of these cells.</p><p>In the TKO model, we found that the colony-forming potential was restricted to two distinct mutant stem/progenitor cell populations in TKO mice, C3/C7/E10<sup>+</sup> cells and Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells. The decreased expression of <italic>Bmi1</italic> and the increased expression of lineage markers, as well as the increased cell cycle and colony-forming activities observed in TKO C3/C7/E10<sup>+</sup> cells suggest that these cells may represent a more mature population of progenitors when compared with Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells. C3/C7/E10<sup>+</sup> or Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells were not able to recapitulate tumors upon transplantation, suggesting that either they do not represent the cell of origin or that transplantation protocols need to be improved to allow a small number of purified stem/progenitor cells to colonize recipient liver.</p><p>Our data strongly suggest that TKO liver tumors arise from subpopulations of stem/progenitor cells. After exiting quiescence and an initial phase of expansion, these TKO cells undergo some differentiation, and these fairly differentiated proliferating cells represent the bulk of the HCC tumors. This model fits with increasing evidence suggesting that loss of RB function initiates cancer from specific populations of stem/progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macpherson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viatour et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>), providing a general model for tumor suppression by the RB pathway. However, we cannot formally exclude at this point that an intermediate cell population (i.e., very late progenitor or early hepatocyte) could also be the cell of origin in TKO HCC. The recent identification of Cre-expressing mouse strains in liver progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dorrell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2011</xref>) may provide novel means to perform lineage-tracing experiments and to formerly identify the cell of origin of the TKO tumors, including its differentiation potential and the role of the RB pathway in its cell fate.</p><p>Previous studies in neural progenitors have reported repression of Notch signaling by p107 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vanderluit et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">2007</xref>). In this study, we found that RB family members directly control the transcription of multiple components of the Notch pathway in human and mouse cells, identifying a strong link between these two central cellular pathways in liver cells. However, the lack of induction of Notch pathway genes in TKO liver progenitor cells suggests that this link is context dependent. More work is needed to understand the regulation of Notch pathway genes by E2F family members in different cell types. Functionally, our data showing that increased Notch activity leads to cell cycle arrest in G2 and/or cell death might be related to observations that inactivation of <italic>Rb</italic> family genes induces a G2 arrest in TKO fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van Harn et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In vivo modulation of Notch pathway activity with DAPT, a &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor and potent inhibitor of Notch signaling, resulted in accelerated cancer development in TKO mice. Interestingly, liver-specific inactivation of <italic>Notch1</italic> expression, although not sufficient to promote HCC, leads to the proliferation of hepatocytes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Croquelois et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, in vivo DAPT treatment failed to increase proliferation in TKO progenitor cells, either because these cells have already reached a very high level of cell cycle activity or because DAPT treatment is not sufficient to block Notch signaling in progenitor cells. In vitro, we found that activation of Notch signaling in mouse and human HCC cells was sufficient to block their expansion, as was reported in one human cell line before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qi et al., 2003</xref>). We further show that HCC cells with enforced expression of NICD undergo cell cycle arrest in G2 and display increased apoptotic activity. The Notch pathway interacts with multiple molecular effectors, and there are probably multiple mechanisms involved in inhibiting tumor cell progression. In the future, thorough investigation of Notch effectors should bring more mechanistic insights into HCC development.</p><p>Our findings suggest a model in which Notch signaling acts as a tumor suppressor feedback mechanism in response to activation of E2F transcription factors in TKO liver cells. Although this negative feedback is clearly not sufficient to prevent cancer initiation, activation of Notch may significantly slow the expansion of tumor cells in vivo, and we found that expression of a Notch pathway signature of 17 genes strongly predicts survival in HCC patients. Because signaling downstream of Notch1 may play a tumor-suppressor role in different cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanlon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganathan et al., 2011</xref>), our observations indicate that local activation of the Notch pathway may provide novel treatment approaches in a large group of human cancers of epithelial origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and tumor experiments.</title><p><italic>Rb</italic> family cTKO mice were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Viatour et al., 2008</xref>) and were maintained in a mixed 129Sv/J;C57/BL6 background.
