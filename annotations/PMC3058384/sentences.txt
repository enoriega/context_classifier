COT and MAP3K8 drives resistance to RAF inhibition through MAP kinase pathway reactivation
Oncogenic mutations in the serine and threonine kinase B-RAF are found in 50-70 % of malignant melanomas .
Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF V600E mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling cascade in melanoma --- an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials - .
However , clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance - .
Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative ' druggable ' targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies .
Here , we expressed ~ 600 kinase and kinase related open reading frames ( ORFs ) in parallel to functionally interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor .
We identified MAP3K8 ( COT and TPL2 ) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF V600E cell lines .
COT activates ERK primarily through MEK dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signaling .
Moreover , COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF V600E cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibition .
We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting .
Together , these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies .
To identify kinases capable of circumventing RAF inhibition , we assembled and stably expressed 597 sequence validated kinase ORF clones representing ~ 75 % of annotated kinases ( Center for Cancer Systems Biology ( CCSB ) / Broad Institute Kinase ORF Collection ) in A375 , a B-RAF V600E malignant melanoma cell line that is sensitive to the RAF kinase inhibitor PLX4720 .
ORF expressing cells treated with 1 microM PLX4720 were screened for viability relative to untreated cells and normalized to an assay specific positive control , MEK1 S218 and 222D ( MEK1 DD ) ( ) .
Nine ORFs conferred resistance at levels exceeding two standard deviations from the mean and were selected for follow-up analysis ( ) .
Three of nine candidate ORFs were receptor tyrosine kinases , underscoring the potential of this class of kinases to engage resistance pathways .
Resistance effects were validated and prioritized across a multi-point PLX4720 drug concentration scale in the B-RAF V600E cell lines A375 and SKMEL28 .
The Ser and Thr MAP kinase kinase kinases ( MAP3Ks ) MAP3K8 ( COT and Tpl2 ) and RAF1 ( C-RAF ) emerged as top candidates from both cell lines ; these ORFs shifted the PLX4720 GI 50 by 10-600 fold without affecting viability ( ) .
Both COT and C-RAF reduced sensitivity to PLX4720 in multiple B-RAF V600E cell lines ( ) confirming the ability of these kinases to mediate resistance to RAF inhibition .
Next , we tested whether overexpression of these genes was sufficient to activate the MAPK pathway .
At baseline , COT expression increased ERK phosphorylation in a manner comparable to MEK1 DD , consistent with MAP kinase pathway activation .
Overexpression of wild-type COT or C-RAF resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in the presence of PLX4720 , whereas kinase-dead derivatives had no effect .
Based on these results , we hypothesized that COT and C-RAF drive resistance to RAF inhibition predominantly through re-activation of MAPK signaling .
Notably , of the nine candidate ORFs from our initial screen , a subset ( 3 ) did not show persistent ERK and MEK phosphorylation following RAF inhibition , suggesting MAPK pathway independent alteration of drug sensitivity ( ) .
Several groups have shown that C-RAF activation and heterodimerization with B-RAF constitute critical components of the cellular response to B-RAF inhibition - .
In A375 cells , endogenous C-RAF : B-RAF heterodimers were measurable and inducible following treatment with PLX4720 ( ) .
However , endogenous C-RAF phosphorylation at S338 -- an event required for C-RAF activation -- remained low ( ) .
In contrast , ectopically expressed C-RAF was phosphorylated on S338 ( ) and its PLX4720 resistance phenotype was associated with sustained MEK and ERK activation .
Moreover , ectopic expression of a high activity C-RAF truncation mutant ( C-RAF ( W22 ) was more effective than wild-type C-RAF in mediating PLX4720 resistance and ERK activation ( ) , further indicating that elevated C-RAF activity may direct resistance to this agent .
Consistent with this model , oncogenic alleles of NRAS and KRAS conferred PLX4720 resistance in A375 cells ( ) and yielded sustained C-RAF ( S338 ) and ERK phosphorylation in the context of drug treatment ( ) .
Thus , although genetic alterations that engender C-RAF activation ( e.g. , oncogenic RAS mutations ) tend to show mutual exclusivity with B-RAF V600E mutation , such co-occurring events , might be favored in the context of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition .
To investigate the role of COT in melanoma , we first determined its expression in human melanocytes .
We found that primary immortalized melanocytes ( B-RAF wild-type ) expressed COT ( ) , although ectopic B-RAF V600E expression reduced COT mRNA levels ( ) and rendered COT protein undetectable ( ) .
Conversely , whereas ectopically expressed COT was only weakly detectable in A375 cells ( ) , shRNA mediated depletion of endogenous B-RAF V600E caused an increase in COT protein levels that correlated with the extent of B-RAF knockdown ( ) .
Moreover , treatment of COT expressing A375 cells with PLX4720 led to a dose dependent increase in COT protein ( ) without affecting ectopic COT mRNA levels ( ) .
Thus , oncogenic B-RAF may antagonize COT expression largely through altered protein stability , and B-RAF inhibition may potentiate the outgrowth of COT expressing cells during the course of treatment .
Notably , neither C-RAF nor B-RAF alone or in combination was required for ERK phosphorylation in the context of COT expression , even in the presence of PLX4720 , suggesting that COT expression is sufficient to induce MAP kinase pathway activation in a RAF independent manner .
We predicted that cell lines expressing elevated COT in a B-RAF V600E background should exhibit de novo resistance to PLX4720 treatment .
To identify such instances , we screened a panel of cell lines for evidence of MAP3K8 and COT copy number gains coincident with the B-RAF V600E mutation .
Of 534 cell lines that had undergone copy number analysis and mutation profiling , 38 cell lines ( 7.1 % ) contained the B-RAF V600E mutation .
Within this subgroup , two cell lines -- OUMS-23 ( colon cancer ) and RPMI-7951 ( melanoma ) -- also showed evidence of chromosomal copy gains spanning the MAP3K8 and COT locus and robust COT protein expression .
We also screened a panel of melanoma short-term cultures for COT protein expression .
Only one of these lines expressed COT : M307 , a short-term culture derived from a B-RAF V600E tumor that developed resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition following initial disease stabilization ( ) .
All three cell lines were refractory to PLX4720 treatment , exhibiting GI 50 values in the range of 8-10 microM ( ) and showing sustained ERK phosphorylation in the context of B-RAF inhibition ( ) .
OUMS-23 and RPMI-7951 are MAPK pathway inhibitor-naive cell lines , implying that COT may confer de novo resistance to RAF inhibition ( a phenomenon observed in ~ 10 % of B-RAF V600E melanomas ) .
Next , we examined COT expression in the context of resistance to the clinical RAF inhibitor PLX4032 by obtaining biopsy material from 3 patients with metastatic , B-RAF V600E melanoma .
Each case consisted of frozen , lesion matched biopsy material obtained prior to and during treatment ( " pre-treatment " and " on-treatment " ; , ) ; additionally , one sample contained two independent biopsy specimens from the same relapsing tumor site ( " post-relapse " ; ) .
Consistent with the experimental models presented above , quantitative real-time RT-PCR ( qRT and PCR ) analysis revealed increased COT mRNA expression concurrent with PLX4032 treatment in 2 of 3 cases .
COT mRNA levels were further increased in a relapsing specimen relative to its pre-treatment and on-treatment counterparts ( , Patient # 1 ) .
An additional , unmatched relapsed malignant melanoma biopsy showed elevated COT mRNA expression comparable to levels observed in RAF inhibitor resistant , COT amplified cell lines ( ) .
This specimen also exhibited robust MAPK pathway activation and elevated expression of B-RAF , C-RAF and COT relative to matched normal skin or B-RAF V600E cell lines ( ) .
Sequencing studies of this tumor revealed no additional mutations in BRAF , NRAS or KRAS ( data not shown ) .
These analyses provided clinical evidence that COT dependent mechanisms may be operant in at least some PLX4032 resistant malignant melanomas .
To determine if COT might actively regulate MEK and ERK phosphorylation in B-RAF V600E cells that harbor naturally elevated COT expression , we introduced shRNA constructs targeting COT into RPMI-7951 cells .
Depletion of COT suppressed RPMI-7951 viability ( ) and decreased ERK phosphorylation ( ) , implying that targeting COT kinase activity might suppress MEK and ERK phosphorylation in cancer cells with COT overexpression or amplification .
Treatment of RPMI-7951 cells with a small molecule COT kinase inhibitor- resulted in dose dependent suppression of MEK and ERK phosphorylation , providing additional evidence that COT contributes to MEK and ERK activation in these cells ( ) .
We then considered whether COT expressing cancer cells remain sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibition at a target downstream of COT or RAF .
Here , we queried the OUMS-23 and RPMI-7951 cell lines for sensitivity to the MEK1 and 2 inhibitor CI-1040 .
Interestingly , both cell lines were refractory to MEK inhibition ( ) and displayed sustained ERK phosphorylation even at 1 microM CI-1040 ( ) .
Ectopic COT expression in A375 and SKMEL28 cells also conferred decreased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitors CI-1040 and AZD6244 , suggesting that COT expression alone was sufficient to induce this phenotype .
Similar to results observed with pharmacological MEK inhibitors , MEK1 and 2 knockdown only modestly suppressed COT mediated ERK phosphorylation in A375 cells ( ) .
In accordance with prior observations , these data raised the possibility that COT may activate ERK through MEK independent and MEK dependent mechanisms .
To test this hypothesis directly , we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant COT and ERK1 .
Indeed , recombinant COT induced pThr202 and Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK1 in vitro ( ) suggesting that in certain contexts , COT expression may potentiate ERK activation in a MEK independent manner .
In experimental models , the use of RAF and MEK inhibitors in combination can override resistance to single-agents .
We therefore reasoned that combined RAF and MEK inhibition might circumvent COT driven resistance .
In the setting of ectopic COT expression , exposure to AZD6244 or CI-1040 in combination with PLX470 ( 1 microM each ) reduced cell growth and pERK expression more effectively than did single-agent PLX4720 , even at concentrations of 10 microM .
These data underscore the importance of this pathway in B-RAF V600E tumor cells and support earlier findings that dual B-RAF and MEK inhibition may help circumvent resistance to RAF inhibitors .
B RAF mutations are found in ~ 8 % of all cancers and at high frequencies in malignant melanoma , colon and thyroid cancers .
The clinical promise of selective RAF inhibitors has widespread ramifications for patient treatment , yet single agent targeted therapy is almost invariably followed by relapse due to acquired drug resistance .
Our results suggest that ORF based , systematic functional screening may offer a powerful means to identify clinically relevant resistance mechanisms that also specify novel treatment strategies .
In particular , resistance to RAF inhibition can be achieved by multiple MAP3K dependent mechanisms of MEK and ERK reactivation but might be intercepted through combined therapeutic modalities for MAPK pathway inhibition ( e.g. , RAF and MEK or RAF and COT combinations ) .
Future systematic drug resistance studies may be expanded to a genome scale that encompasses many compounds , thereby enabling comprehensive identification of both therapy specific resistance genes and drug targets of novel therapeutics .

Materials and Methods
Center for Cancer Systems Biology ( CCSB ) / Broad Institute Kinase Open Reading Frame Collection
We assembled a library of 597 kinase ORFs in pDONR-223 Entry vectors ( Invitrogen ) .
Individual clones were end sequenced using vector specific primers in both directions .
Clones with substantial deviations from reported sequences were discarded .
Entry clones and sequences are available via Addgene ( www.addgene.org/human_kinases ) .
Kinase ORFs were assembled from multiple sources ; 337 kinases were isolated as single clones from the ORFeome 5.1 collection ( horfdb.dfci.harvard.edu ) ; 183 kinases were cloned from normal human tissue RNA ( Ambion ) by reverse transcription and subsequent PCR amplification to add Gateway sequences ( Invitrogen ) ; 64 kinases were cloned from templates provided by the Harvard Institute of Proteomics ( HIP ) ; and 13 kinases were cloned into the Gateway system from templates obtained from collaborating laboratories .
The Gateway-compatible lentiviral vector pLX-Blast-V5 was created from the pLKO .1 backbone .
LR reactions were performed to introduce the 597 kinases into pLX-Blast-V5 according to manufacturers protocol ( Invitrogen ) .
High throughout ORF screening
A375 melanoma cells were plated in 384-well microtiter plates ( 500 cells per well ) .
The following day , cells were spin infected with the lentivirally packaged kinase ORF library in the presence of 8 ug and ml polybrene .
48 hours post-infection , media was replaced with standard growth media ( 2 replicates ) , media containing 1 microM PLX4720 ( 2 replicates , 2 time points ) or media containing 10 ug and ml blasticidin ( 2 replicates ) .
After four days and 6 days , cell growth was assayed using Cell Titer-Glo ( Promega ) according to manufacturer instructions .
The entire experiment was performed twice .
Identification of candidate resistance ORFs
Raw luminescence values were imported into Microsoft Excel .
Infection efficiency was determined by the percentage of duplicate averaged raw luminescence in blasticidin selected cells relative to non selected cells .
ORFs with an infection efficiency of less than 0.70 were excluded from further analysis along with any ORF having a standard deviation of > 15,000 raw luminescence units between duplicates .
To identify ORFs whose expression affects proliferation , we compared the duplicate averaged raw luminescence of individual ORFs against the average and standard deviation of all control treated cells via the z-score , or standard score , below , z = x-musigma where x = average raw luminescence of a given ORF , mu = the mean raw luminescence of all ORFs and sigma = the standard deviation of the raw luminescence of all wells .
Any individual ORF with a z-score > +2 or < -2 was annotated as affecting proliferation and removed from final analysis .
Differential proliferation was determined by the percentage of duplicate averaged raw luminescence values in PLX4720 ( 1 microM ) treated cells relative to untreated cells .
Subsequently , differential proliferation was normalized to the positive control for PLX4720 resistance , MEK1 S218 and 222D ( MEK1 DD ) , with MEK1 DD differential proliferation = 1.0 .
MEK1 DD normalized differential proliferation for each individual ORF was averaged across two duplicate experiments , with two time points for each experiment ( day 4 and day 6 ) .
A z-score was then generated , as described above , for average MEK1 DD normalized differential proliferation .
ORFs with a z-score of > 2 were considered hits and were followed up in the secondary screen .
