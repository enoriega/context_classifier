Qualitative Regulation of B Cell Antigen Receptor Signaling by CD19 : Selective Requirement for PI3-Kinase Activation , Inositol-1 ,4,5 - Trisphosphate Production and Ca 2+ Mobilization
Genetic ablation of the B cell surface glycoprotein CD19 severely impairs the humoral immune response .
This requirement is thought to reflect a critical role of CD19 in signal transduction that occurs upon antigen C3dg coligation of antigen receptors with CD19 containing type 2 complement receptors ( CR2 ) .
Here we show that CD19 plays a key accessory role in B cell antigen receptor signaling independent of CR2 coligation and define molecular circuitry by which this function is mediated .
While CD19 is not required for antigen mediated activation of receptor proximal tyrosines kinases , it is critical for activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3-kinase ) .
PI3-Kinase activation is dependent on phosphorylation of CD19 Y484 and Y515 .
Antigen induced CD19 dependent PI3-kinase activation is required for normal phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca 2+ mobilization responses .
Thus , CD19 functions as a B cell antigen receptor accessory molecule that modifies antigen receptor signaling in a qualitative manner .
CD19 is a B-lymphocyte-specific transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed from the pro-B cell until the plasma cell stage .
CD19 appears to function in multiple capacities .
It is a component of the type 2 complement receptor ( CR2 ) 1 complex that contains CD19 , CD21 ( CR2 ) , CD81 , ( TAPA-1 ) , and Leu-13 .
CR2 is expressed by mature B cells and is activated upon binding of C3dg ( reviewed in reference ) .
Evidence indicates that CD19 may also be a constitutive component of the B cell antigen receptor ( BCR ) complex and is phosphorylated upon BCR crosslinking ( ) .
Finally , although its ligand has not been identified , CD19 appears to function as a transducer in pro- and pre-B cells where it is expressed in the absence of CD21 and the BCR .
The function of CD19 in these various contexts is poorly understood .
CD19 is a highly conserved protein containing two immunoglobulin like domains in its extracellular aspect and nine potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic tail ( ) .
It is tyrosine phosphorylated upon cell activation in all three of the signaling contexts described above , presumably by Lyn , Fyn , or Lck associated with unligated CD19 ( - ) .
After phosphorylation , tyrosines Y 484 XXM and Y 515 XXM motifs have been shown to mediate the association of the p85-subunit of PI3-kinase with CD19 ( ) .
In addition the proto-oncogene product Vav has been shown to associate with phosphorylated CD19 ( ) , presumably through the Y 393 EEP motif which is predicted once phosphorylated to bind Vav ( ) .
In vitro studies involving CD19 coimmunoprecipitated from stimulated Ramos B cells have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylated CD19 can interact with PI3-kinase , Fyn , PLCgamma1 and GAP SH2 domains suggesting the interaction of multiple signaling molecules with the CD19 cytoplasmic tail .
CD19 function has been studied primarily in the context of its role as a member of the CR2 receptor complex ( 14- 16 ) .
CD19 signal transduction is activated by binding of the C3dg fragment of the C3 component of complement to CD21 .
Coligation of CD19 or CD21 with BCR causes a synergistic increase in a number of intracellular BCR mediated signaling events , including Shc and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation , PLC activation and calcium mobilization ( ) .
Coligation also lowers the threshold for antigen stimulation of B cell proliferation ( ) and enhances by < = 10,000-fold the immunogenicity of antigen-complement complexes ( HEL-C3dg ) ( ) .
Antibody crosslinking of CD19 on certain immature B cell lines that do not express mIg has been shown to induce activation of Src family kinases and tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and Vav .
In this context CD19 crosslinking also results in PLC activation , calcium mobilization and activation of the MAP kinase cascade .
Finally , anti-Ig stimulation of the BCR without CD19 cocrosslinking results in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 , indicating that CD19 is a target of BCR activated kinases .
Also , anti-IgM stimulation of Daudi B cells leads to an increase in CD19 association with PI3-kinase ( ) .
Consistent with this finding , several studies indicate that CD19 may be physically associated with the BCR .
Incubation of B cells with Ig specific mAb leads to mIg and CD19 comodulation and cocapping .
In Daudi B cells CD19 can be coimmunoprecipitated with mIgM ( ) .
Whether CD21 , Leu-13 and CD81 are required for the constitutive association of CD19 with the BCR is unknown ; however CD19 expression levels in mature B cells appear to be about fivefold higher than CD21 expression levels ( ) suggesting that CD19 occurs in both CD21 associated and -nonassociated forms .
Recent production of CD19 knockout mice have provided an opportunity to analyze B cell function in the absence of CD19 .
B cell development appears normal in these mice , but humoral immune responses are defective and B cells are unresponsive to antigen receptor stimulation as indicated by proliferation .
In this study we have investigated the constitutive role of CD19 in BCR mediated signal transduction using CD19 deficient and -sufficient J558Lmum3CD45 + plasmacytoma variants and primary B lymphocytes from CD19 -/ - and CD19 + /+ mice .
Our results demonstrate a critical role for CD19 in antigen mediated BCR activation of multiple signaling events .
CD19 expression is required for detectable BCR mediated PI3-kinase activation and for maximal phosphoinositide hydrolysis and calcium mobilization .
The latter effects appear causally linked to failed PI3-kinase activation .
Other more subtle effects of CD19 on BCR signaling include increased antigen mediated Lyn and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation , but these are not attributable to enhanced PI3-kinase activation .

Results
Although tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 after BCR ligation is well documented , the contribution of CD19 to BCR signaling is not defined .
To study the role of CD19 in antigen induced signal transduction we generated a wild-type CD19 positive and Y 484 and Y515 to F CD19 positive variant of the J558Lmum3CD45 + plasmacytoma .
The parent clone expresses a NP specific BCR and CD45 , but does not express CD19 .
Human CD19 ( hCD19 ) was introduced into this clone by retroviral infection , and lines ( polyclonal populations ) were isolated by G418 selection and fluorescence activated cell sorting of cells .
Flow cytometric analysis revealed similar expression levels of sIgM , CD45 and CD19 in the plasmacytoma cell lines .
Human CD19 was utilized since antibodies to mouse CD19 were not available at the time the studies were undertaken , and human and mouse CD19 are highly homologous ( 79 % in nucleotide sequence , 75 % in amino acid sequence ) particularly in the cytoplasmic domain .
Recent studies indicate that human CD19 complements B cell function in CD19 -/ - mice ( ) .
In addition , using a recently generated rat mAb , 1D3 , specific for murine CD19 ( ) , Krop et al. .
( ) have demonstrated that murine CD19 shares with human CD19 an association with complement receptor CD21 and CD81 , tyrosine phosphorylation , binding of PI3-kinase , and synergistic signaling with membrane IgM .
Antigen stimulated Intracellular Ca 2+ Release and Extracellular Ca 2+ Influx Is Increased in Cells Expressing CD19 .
To investigate the differences in BCR signaling in the CD19 negative and -positive contexts , we loaded the J558Lmum3 CD45 + CD19 negative and CD19 positive variants with indo-1 AM and analyzed changes in intracellular free calcium concentration ( [ Ca 2+ ] i ) in response to antigen stimulation .
Initially , this was done under conditions where the free calcium concentration in the medium ( [ Ca 2+ ] o ) was maintained at physiological levels of 1.3 mM .
As shown in Fig .
( solid lines ) , antigen stimulation induced a rise in [ Ca 2+ ] i in both cell lines ; in the CD19 positive cell line the maximal mean [ Ca 2+ ] i reached 430 nM while it was 260 nM in the CD19 negative cells .
In the CD19 positive cell line , antigen stimulation also induced a much more prolonged increase in [ Ca 2+ ] i than in the CD19 negative clone .
To determine whether intracellular or extracellular calcium was responsible for the respective [ Ca 2+ ] i increases , we added 3 mM EGTA at the time of initiation of analysis of [ Ca 2+ ] i .
This results in buffering of [ Ca 2+ ] o to a concentration of 65 nM ( which corresponds to the [ Ca 2+ ] i in resting cells ) and prevents influx of extracellular calcium into the cell .
Comparison of antigen induced responses of CD19 negative and CD19 positive cells in low [ Ca 2+ ] o indicated that optimal receptor mediated release of calcium from intracellular stores requires CD19 .
Comparison of responses in high [ Ca 2+ ] o revealed that influx is also dependent on the expression of CD19 .
Antigen Stimulation of Inositol-1 ,4,5 - trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) Production Is Dependent on CD19 Expression .
To study CD19 dependence of signaling events upstream from calcium mobilization , we first compared antigen stimulation of IP 3 production in CD19 positive and -negative cells .
IP 3 binds to its receptors on the ER leading to release of Ca 2+ into the cytoplasm .
Emptying of the ER stores triggers entry of calcium from the extracellular space by a mechanism known as capacitative Ca 2+ entry ( ) .
Thus , CD19 dependence of IP 3 generation induced response by antigen could explain the dependence of both intracellular calcium release and extracellular calcium influx on CD19 expression .
Stimulation of the cell lines led to a very rapid and sustained rise in IP 3 production in the CD19 positive clone as measured using an IP 3 -receptor binding inhibition assay .
Antigen stimulation of the CD19 negative clone led to rapid , but much more modest and only transient generation of IP 3 .
The kinetics and magnitude of IP 3 generation was consistent with those of calcium mobilization responses shown in Fig .
supporting the possibility that the attenuated calcium mobilization response may be caused by the attenuated BCR mediated hydrolysis of PIP 2 .
We also measured the generation of [ 3 H ] - inositol mono- and polyphosphates after antigen stimulation of myo - [ 2- 3 H ( N ) ] - inositol labeled cell lines .
As shown in Fig .
B the fold increase in total inositol mono- and polyphosphates generated during a 25-min stimulation was consistent with the mass measurement of IP 3 production ; stimulation of the CD19 positive clone led to an ~ 250 % increase in inositol phosphate generation , while stimulation of the CD19 negative cell line induced an ~ 30 % increase .
CD19 Expression Enhances BCR mediated Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation .
Antigen stimulation is known to induce recruitment of Src- and Syk family tyrosine kinases to Ig-alpha and Ig-beta components of the BCR ( - ) .
The tyrosine kinases bind via their SH2-domains to immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motif ( ITAM ) phosphotyrosines and this leads to secondary recruitment , phosphorylation , and activation of downstream signaling molecules such as PLCgamma1 , PLCgamma2 , and PI3-kinase ( reviewed in reference ) .
To define the effects of CD19 expression on these phosphorylation events we stimulated CD19 negative and -positive cell lines , immunoprecipitated intracellular signaling molecules and conducted anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting analysis .
The spectra of phosphoproteins in whole cell lysates from the J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 - and the J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 + cell lines looked similar with the exception of the presence of a tyrosine phosphorylated CD19 in the CD19 positive cell lysate ( results not shown ) .
Induced phosphorylation of several signaling molecules was analyzed after stimulation with normalization of immunoprecipitation and lane loading by sequential antieffector immunoblotting .
We studied tyrosine phosphorylation after 1 min of antigen stimulation since we have shown previously that effector enzymes under study are maximally phosphorylated at this time in the J558Lmum3CD45 + plasmacytoma ( ) .
As shown in Fig .
, CD19 expression led to modest increases in antigen induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig-alpha , Lyn , Syk , PLCgamma1 , and PLCgamma2 .
Quantitation of tyrosine phosphorylation by scanning densitometry ( at least three independent experiments for each effector enzyme ) and normalization to effector levels revealed increased phosphorylation of Ig-alpha , Lyn , and Syk by 1.5-2-fold in the CD19 positive line .
Induced PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation was 2.5-3-fold higher in the CD19 positive cell line than in the CD19 negative cell line .
These results suggest that CD19 functions in part by increasing the magnitude of certain proximal BCR coupled tyrosine phosphorylation events .
Antigen Stimulation of PI3-Kinase Activation Is Severely Impaired in the CD19 negative J558Lmum3CD45 + Plasmacytoma .
CD19 contains two cytoplasmic YXXM motifs that mediate its association with the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase after phosphorylation of the tyrosines ( ) .
The phosphorylation of these tyrosines may contribute to BCR mediated PI3-kinase activation .
We determined the activity of PI3-kinase in the cell lines by measuring the PI3-kinase activity associated with anti-p85 immunoprecipitates after stimulation with NP 9 BSA for 2 min .
The results shown in Fig .
demonstrate a 250 % increase in PI3-kinase activity in the CD19 positive cell line after antigen stimulation , but only a 40 % increase in the CD19 negative variant .
The residual activation of PI3-kinase in the absence of CD19 expression is probably a result of PI3-kinase activation through interaction with SH3 domains of Src family kinases ( ) .
The results described above are summarized in the two first columns of Table .
It is clear that CD19 influences multiple intracellular signaling events .
Some signaling events are only slightly increased in the CD19 positive cell line , ( i.e. , Ig-alpha , Lyn , and Syk tyrosine phosphorylation ) while others are almost totally dependent on expression of CD19 ( i.e. , IP 3 generation , calcium influx , and PI3-kinase activation ) .
Wortmannin Inhibits Antigen induced [ Ca 2+ ] i Mobilization and IP 3 Generation in the J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 + Plasmacytoma .
To begin to dissect the relationship among the observed CD19 effects , we assessed the effects of the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin on signaling events .
Wortmannin has been shown to inhibit PI3-kinase activity by covalent modification of a lysine residue in the PI3-kinase catalytic subunit , p110 ( ) .
We also used the competitive PI3-kinase inhibitor Ly294002 ( ) and obtained similar results as in our studies with wortmannin ( results not shown ) .
The effect of wortmannin on antigen induced activation of PI3-kinase was determined .
The results shown in Fig .
A demonstrate the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on antigen mediated PI3-kinase activation in the J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 + plasmacytoma .
Cells were pretreated for 30 min with DMSO ( vehicle ) or increasing concentrations of wortmannin , stimulated with antigen for 2 min , washed , and then lysed before PI3-kinase was immunoprecipitated and activity measured in an in vitro kinase assay with phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) containing vesicles as substrate .
Consistent with its previously established IC 50 , 10 nM wortmannin inhibited the antigen mediated PI3-kinase activation by 54 % , and 25 nM wortmannin inhibited 75 % of antigen induced PI3-kinase activity .
Wortmannin added to the cells immediately before washing and lysis did not effect the PI3-kinase activity ( data not shown ) indicating that the inhibitor was acting intracellularly .
To investigate the influence of PI3-kinase on the BCR mediated calcium mobilization seen in the CD19 positive cell line , we preincubated the cells with increasing concentrations of wortmannin and measured the antigen induced increase in [ Ca 2+ ] i .
As shown in Fig .
B , wortmannin strongly inhibited Ca 2+ mobilization in the J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 + cells .
Sensitivity to wortmannin was also evident in the IP 3 generation response .
A wortmannin concentration of 25 nM strongly inhibited IP 3 production in the J558Lmum3 CD45 + CD19 + cell line after 1 minute of antigen stimulation .
In both cases wortmannin at a concentration of 25 nM converted the phenotype of the CD19 positive cells essentially to that of the CD19 negative cells .
This result was consistent with the 75 % inhibition of PI3-kinase activation by 25 nM wortmannin in Fig .
A and indicates that the CD19 requirement for IP 3 production and calcium mobilization may be attributable to PI3-kinase activation .
Interestingly , wortmannin inhibited the residual antigen stimulated PI3-kinase activation , IP 3 production , and Ca 2+ mobilization of the CD19 negative cell line ( data not shown ) consistent with the possible absolute dependence of these responses on PI3-kinase activation .
Induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Intracellular Effector Enzymes Is Insensitive to Wortmannin .
To investigate the potential role of CD19 activated PI3-kinase on early BCR mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation events , CD19 positive cells were preincubated for 30 min with DMSO ( vehicle ) or increasing concentrations of wortmannin and stimulated for 1 min with antigen before effectors were immunoprecipitated and analyzed .
As shown in Fig .
, antigen induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig-alpha , Lyn , and Syk was insensitive to wortmannin .
PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation was somewhat sensitive to wortmannin preincubation although the decrease in induced tyrosine phosphorylation was modest ( 35 % inhibition at 25 nM wortmannin , Table ) compared with the degree of wortmannin inhibition of IP 3 generation and calcium mobilization ( 91.5 % inhibition , Table ) .
It seems very unlikely that the > 90 % inhibition of PLCgamma activity could be caused by a 35 % inhibition of PLCgamma phosphorylation Thus , as summarized in Table , CD19 expression by the J558Lmum3 CD45 + plasmacytoma is required for optimal antigen stimulation of multiple intracellular signaling events , but only some of these are secondary to the nearly absolute dependence of PI3-kinase activation on CD19 .
Mutation of p85 Binding Sites Destroy the Ability of CD19 to Mediate an Increase in BCR mediated [ Ca 2+ ] i Mobilization .
To further explore the requirement of CD19 for PI3-kinase activation and optimal antigen mediated [ Ca 2+ ] i mobilization , we introduced a double point mutant of CD19 , CD19Y 484 F , Y 515 F , into the J558Lmum3CD45 + plasmacytoma .
The expression levels of sIgM , CD45 and CD19 ( Y 484 F , Y 515 F ) in this cell line is shown in Fig .
.
It has previously been demonstrated that the mutations Y 484 F and Y 515 F abrogates the ability of CD19 to interact with the p85-subunit of PI3-kinase ( ) .
Like the CD19 negative cell line , the CD19 mutant cell line , showed no significant antigen mediated activation of PI3-kinase ( results not shown ) .
When we assayed the ability of the cell line expressing the mutant CD19 to mobilize [ Ca 2+ ] i in response to antigen stimulation , we found that the mutant CD19 cell line behaved equivalently to the J558Lmum3CD45 + cell line .
This suggests that both CD19 mediated increase in BCR induced PI3-kinase activation and Ca 2+ mobilization require phosphorylation of CD19 Y 484 and Y 515 .
Wortmannin Inhibits Antigen stimulated [ Ca 2+ ] i Mobilization in Splenic B Cells .
To investigate the role of PI3-kinase in antigen induced signaling in a more physiological system , we purified splenic B cells ( rho < = 1.066 ) from spleens of normal mice and assessed the effects of wortmannin on BCR signaling .
After preincubation for 30 min with DMSO or wortmannin , splenic B cells were stimulated with 13.2 mug and 10 6 cells F ( ab ' ) 2 RAMIG .
As observed in the J558L mum3CD45 + CD19 + cell line , wortmannin inhibited , as a function of its concentration , the antigen mediated calcium mobilization in these primary B cells .
Wortmannin also inhibited the residual antibody mediated Ca 2+ mobilization in CD19 -/ - splenic B cells ( data not shown ) .
Thus , BCR signaling in J558Lmum3CD45 + CD19 + and normal B cells is similarly sensitive to PI3-kinase inhibition and CD19 function ( see below ) .
CD19 Is Required for Anti-BCR Stimulation of PI3-Kinase Activation and Ca 2+ Mobilization in Splenic B Cells .
To extend our observations regarding CD19 dependence of BCR mediated signaling in B lymphocytes we compared BCR mediated PI3-kinase activation and calcium mobilization responses of B cells from CD19 knockout mice and normal mice .
It has previously been reported that no distinguishable difference can be seen between CD19 deficient and normal B cells in the pattern or the degree of substrate phosphorylation after surface immunoglobulin stimulation ( ) .
We obtained the same results when comparing whole cell lysates from CD19 -/ - and CD19 + /+ cells ( results not shown ) .
However , careful investigation of several signaling events revealed that rho < = 1.066 resting splenic B lymphocytes from CD19 -/ - mice are impaired in their response to surface immunoglobulin crosslinking when compared with CD19 + /+ littermates .
F ( ab ' ) 2 RAMIG mediated PI3-kinase activation was severely diminished in the CD19 -/ - B cells , reminiscent of the situation in the plasmacytoma cell lines .
As shown in Fig .
, absence of CD19 also clearly affects BCR mediated calcium mobilization .
A decrease in calcium mobilization was seen in B lymphocytes from the CD19 -/ - mice in response to stimulation with an optimal dose of antibody .
At suboptimal concentrations of antibody ( 1.3 mug F ( ab ' ) 2 RAMIG ) almost no BCR mediated calcium mobilization was seen in cells from CD19 -/ - mice , while cells from the CD19 + /+ littermates still responded well .
We obtained equivalent results in 10 independent experiments .
Our results appear to conflict with those of Sato et al. ( 34 ) , who observed enhancement of later phase Ca 2+ mobilization in CD19 -/ - cells .
These contrasting findings may result from technical differences in the respective studies .
Discussion
Recent studies of CD19 -/ - mice and CD19 transgenic mice have demonstrated the importance of CD19 in B cell development , but particularly in the immune response of mature B cells .
In human CD19 transgenic mice B cell development is impaired ( ) as indicated by the fact that these mice have dramatically fewer B cells in the periphery .
In these transgenic animals proper B cell development is very sensitive to even small increases in CD19 expression levels ( ) .
CD19 -/ - mice also have lower levels of B cells in the periphery , and mature B cells from these animals mount a poor proliferative response to anti-BCR antibodies .
These animals respond only weakly to T cell dependent antigens , germinal center formation is lacking or diminished , and the serum immunoglobulin levels are significantly reduced .
Based on these findings , it has been suggested that CD19 functions by enhancing the cellular sensitivity to antigen , setting the threshold for antigen mediated signaling ( ) .
This may reflect a CR2 dependent coreceptor function and and or an accessory function of CD19 in BCR signal transduction .
Here we have defined an important accessory function for CD19 in antigen induced BCR signal transduction and described a molecular basis for this accessory function .
CD19 was found to influence the magnitude of activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways after antigen stimulation of the BCR .
While expression of CD19 leads to modestly enhanced antigen induced Ig-alpha , Lyn , Syk , PLCgamma1 , and PLCgamma2-inductive tyrosine phosphorylation , CD19 is absolutely required in order to obtain substantial PI3-kinase activation , IP 3 generation , and maximal calcium mobilization .
Thus , CD19 modifies BCR signaling in a qualitative manner .
Using the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin we further determined that while the increased antigen induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig-alpha , Lyn , and Syk is independent of PI3-kinase activation , differences in IP 3 turnover and calcium mobilization are a function of PI3-kinase activation .
Results obtained in CD19 positive and -negative variants of the J558Lmum3CD45 + plasmacytoma cells were confirmed using primary B lymphocytes from CD19 -/ - mice and wild-type littermates .
Thus , CD19 functions in promoting BCR mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis via activation of PI3-kinase , and also supports antigen induced phosphorylation of BCR receptor components and receptor activated kinases by an unknown mechanism .
Since the src family kinases Lyn and Lck are found associated with CD19 in unstimulated cells , CD19 may mediate the latter effect via an increase in Ig-alpha phosphorylation by these kinases .
It has been demonstrated previously that wortmannin can inhibit angiotensin II mediated IP 3 production in adrenal glomerulosa cells ( ) as well as anti-DNP-IgE-mediated IP 3 production in RBL-2H3 cells ( ) .
The mechanisms by which PI3-kinase affects inositol lipid hydrolysis is unclear .
PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 are highly homologous enzymes ; both contain two SH2 domains and one SH3 domain .
In vitro studies suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzymes is required to increase the catalytic activity , but phosphatase treatment of phosphorylated PLCgamma1 only partially inhibits PLCgamma1 mediated inositol trisphosphate production ( ) , indicating that mechanisms other than tyrosine phosphorylation may regulate PLCgamma1 activation .
Our studies using the PI3-kinase inhibitor , wortmannin , indicate that antigen stimulated inositol lipid turnover and calcium mobilization are dependent on PI3-kinase activation in B cells .
Interestingly , induction of PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation is relatively insensitive to wortmannin .
As shown in Table , IP 3 production is substantially inhibited by 10 nM wortmannin , while this concentration of wortmannin has a neglectable effect on PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 tyrosine phosphorylation .
PI3-kinase phosphorylates the phosphoinositol containing lipids ; PI , PI ( 4 ) P and PI ( 4,5 ) P 2 at the D3 position of the inositol ring ( ) .
Two of the products of this phosphorylation , PI ( 3,4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 , are important regulators of cell proliferation ( ) .
Recently it was suggested that PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 may play a role in signaling by associating with SH2 domains , and thereby modulating PI3-kinase association with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins ( ) .
PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 could thereby regulate the activity of SH2 containing effector enzymes either directly or indirectly by relocating them .
We suggest that this may reflect PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 , the product of PI3-kinase , association with the SH2 domain of PLCgamma1 and translocation of the enzyme to the plasma membrane where its substrate resides .
Indeed addition of PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 to substrate vesicles has been shown to increase PLCgamma hydrolysis of PI ( 4,5 ) P 2 ( ) .
It has been demonstrated in other cell types that cell stimulation results in translocation of PLCgamma1 and PLCgamma2 from the cytosol to the membrane .
This suggests that activation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis involves both a PLCgamma tyrosine phosphorylation event and a translocation event .
Alternatively , or additionally , interactions between PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains could be involved in translocation of effector proteins to the membrane to obtain optimal phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca 2+ mobilization .
A likely candidate is Bruton 's tyrosine kinase , Btk , which has been shown to selectively interact with PI ( 3,4,5 ) P 3 vesicles via its PH domain ( ) .
Indeed recent findings suggest that Btk is required for BCR mediated Ca 2+ mobilization ; in particular for extracellular influx ( Rawlings , D. , personal communication ) .
In this regard we do see a higher antigen mediated inductive tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk in our CD19 positive plasmacytoma cell line than in the CD19 negative line , suggesting that CD19 may influence the activation of Btk ( results not shown ) .
Recently it was shown in both T cells and B cells that under certain circumstances cell stimulation can lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma , but no IP 3 production or calcium mobilization ( , - ) .
These examples further underscores the concept that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCgamma is not in itself sufficient to induce maximal IP 3 generation .
A critical role for CD19 phosphorylation in BCR activation of PI3-kinase , IP 3 production , and calcium mobilization is also supported by studies of FcgammaRIIB1 signal transduction .
We and others have recently shown that coligation of BCR with FcgammaRIIB1 leads to rapid dephosphorylation of CD19 and failed PI3-kinase activation .
Therefore , FcgammaRIIB1 mediated CD19 dephosphorylation appears to prevent the normal contribution of CD19 to BCR signaling .
Importantly , FcgammaRIIB1 cocrosslinking with BCR also results in aborted IP 3 production and reduced calcium mobilization .
Thus , the calcium mobilization and IP 3 production phenotypes of the CD19 positive and -negative cell lines are clearly reminiscent of the signaling phenotypes of B cells stimulated with F ( ab ' ) 2 or intact antibodies , respectively .
F ( ab ' ) 2 stimulation leads to a strong increase in both intracellular and extracellular [ Ca 2+ ] i mobilization , comparable to the antigen mediated calcium mobilization in the CD19 positive cells , and a strong and sustained IP 3 production .
In contrast coengagement of the FcgammaRIIB1 receptor by stimulation with intact antibodies only induces a transient production of IP 3 , and calcium mobilization as seen in the CD19 negative B cell line ( Figs .
and ) .
These data support a role for CD19 and its effector PI3-kinase in BCR mediated PLCgamma activation and calcium mobilization .
Since our studies indicate that CD19 is required for maximal ( i.e. , both primary and secondary phase ) Ca 2+ mobilization , modulation of CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation , and resulting modulation of [ Ca 2+ ] i mobilization pattern may be important in differentially regulating downstream signaling pathways such as activation of MAP kinase pathways , transcription factors , and proliferation and apoptosis responses .
Recently it was demonstrated that the amplitude and duration of Ca 2+ signals contribute to transcriptional specificity ( ) .
Such effects could at least in part be a consequence of the contribution of CD19 , i.e. , stimulation of B lymphocytes with F ( ab ' ) 2 RAMIG , in which case CD19 is highly tyrosine phosphorylated , leads to a Ca 2+ spike and a constant elevated second phase Ca 2+ response .
In contrast binding of immune complexes to FcgammaRIIB1 and the BCR , in which case CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation is decreased , results in a Ca 2+ spike , but no prolonged second phase Ca 2+ response triggering an effector output different from the F ( ab ' ) 2 RAMIG stimulation .
These modulations of the Ca 2+ response may result in modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis .
Splenic B cells proliferate in response to B cell mitogens such as Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) and anti-IgM .
The SA proliferation response is partially inhibited by the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin ( ) , consistent with a role of PI3-kinase in BCR mediated proliferation responses .
CD19 activation may also be important for the regulation of apoptosis .
When immune complexes are bound to the FcgammaRIIB1 and the BCR , in which case CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation is decreased , B cell proliferation is inhibited and cells undergo apoptosis ( ) .
We hypothesize that this inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis is a consequence of inhibition of PI3-kinase activity associated with CD19 , leading to inhibition of downstream signaling pathways .
Potentially FcgammaRIIB1 mediated inhibition of CD19 tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-kinase activation could result in a failure to activate the serine / threonine protein kinase Akt and PKB , which has been shown to be a target of PI3-kinase ( - ) , and is known to protect cells against apoptosis ( - ) .
Here we have demonstrated a potential molecular basis for the essential role played by CD19 in antigen mediated B cell activation , germinal center formation and generation of immune responses .
CD19 functions as a constitutive component of the BCR signaling apparatus and is required for antigen mediated BCR stimulation of PI3-kinase activation and , via PI3-kinase activation , phosphoinositide hydrolysis , and calcium mobilization .
In fact , this is the first formal demonstration that CD19 modifies BCR signaling directly .
The findings have important biological implications since CD19 and BCR expression are differentially regulated during B cell development .
Variation of the ratio of expression of these molecules may provide a mechanism to vary the output of the receptor as a function of cell differentiation stage .
Of potential importance in this context is the fact that the contribution of CD19 to BCR signaling is qualitative ; it does not simply change the magnitude of the signal .
