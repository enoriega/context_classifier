Phosphoinositide 3-Kinasegamma Controls the Intracellular Localization of CpG to Limit DNA-PKcs-Dependent IL-10 Production in Macrophages
Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs ( CpG ) stimulate innate immune responses .
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) has been implicated in CpG induced immune activation ; however , its precise role has not yet been clarified .
CpG induced production of IL-10 was dramatically increased in macrophages deficient in PI3Kgamma ( p110gamma -/ - ) .
By contrast , LPS induced production of IL-10 was unchanged in the cells .
CpG induced , but not LPS induced , IL-10 production was almost completely abolished in SCID mice having mutations in DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ( DNA-PKcs ) .
Furthermore , wortmannin , an inhibitor of DNA-PKcs , completely inhibited CpG induced IL-10 production , both in wild type and p110gamma -/ - cells .
Microscopic analyses revealed that CpG preferentially localized with DNA-PKcs in p110gamma -/ - cells than in wild type cells .
In addition , CpG was preferentially co-localized with the acidic lysosomal marker , LysoTracker , in p110gamma -/ - cells , and with an early endosome marker , EEA1 , in wild type cells .
Over-expression of p110gamma in Cos7 cells resulted in decreased acidification of CpG containing endosome .
A similar effect was reproduced using kinase dead mutants , but not with a ras binding site mutant , of p110gamma .
Thus , it is likely that p110gamma , in a manner independent of its kinase activity , inhibits the acidification of CpG containing endosomes .
It is considered that increased acidification of CpG containing endosomes in p110gamma -/ - cells enforces endosomal escape of CpG , which results in increased association of CpG with DNA-PKcs to up-regulate IL-10 production in macrophages .
Introduction
Oligodeoxynucleotides containing unmethylated CpG motifs ( CpG ) are powerful immune adjuvants that induce the production of cytokines , including IL-6 , IL-10 , IL-12 , IFN-alpha and beta , and TNF-alpha , .
Although previous studies have established that CpG induced immune responses are mediated by endosomal TLR9 -, cytoplasmic DNA-PKcs are also involved in CpG signaling independent of TLR9 , .
Thus , intracellular trafficking of CpG is critical to select downstream signaling molecules , which determine the cytokine species produced by macrophages , .
Phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) has been reported to be both a positive and negative regulator of CpG mediated cytokine production .
CpG induced IL-12 production is increased in plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) from p85alpha -/ - mice , and by treatment of wild-type pDC with wortmannin .
Likewise , CpG induced iNOS expression is increased by treating RAW264 .7 cells with wortmannin .
By contrast , another group has reported that wortmannin inhibits CpG induced production of IL-12 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , and NO from RAW264 .7 cells .
This inhibition has been considered to be the result of wortmannin mediated disruption of class III PI3K signaling , which is responsible for CpG uptake .
Similarly , wortmannin inhibits CpG induced IL-12 production by inhibiting CpG internalization in mouse derived bone marrow cells .
In human pDC , another PI3K inhibitor , LY294002 , also inhibits CpG induced type I IFN production .
In this case , the uptake and endosomal trafficking of CpG are not affected , but nuclear translocation of IRF-7 was inhibited by LY294002 , and also , by a specific inhibitor of PI3Kdelta , IC87114 .
In addition , the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway plays a substantial role in the spatial interaction of TLR9/MyD88/IRF7 , which is indispensable for the induction of type I IFN production by pDC .
These reports have indicated that PI3Ks play some roles in trafficking of CpG itself or its downstream molecules .
Pan- and and or some other specific PI3K inhibitors were used in all of the previous studies described above .
All of these inhibitors bind competitively to the ATP binding pocket of PI3Ks and block kinase activity .
Since DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ( DNA-PKcs ) shares similar ATP binding site as a member of the PI3K like kinase family , these inhibitors , even isoform specific inhibitors , more or less inhibit DNA-PKcs .
This makes it difficult to elucidate the precise role of DNA-PKcs and PI3Ks in CpG mediated cytokine production .
In this paper , we used class IB PI3K ( p110gamma ) knockout mice and SCID mice having mutations in DNA-PKcs to estimate their roles in CpG mediated cytokine production .
In agreement with a current report , DNA-PKcs play a substantial role in CpG mediated IL-10 production in macrophages .
By contrast , p110gamma specifically down-regulates IL-10 production following CpG stimulation .
Quantitative analysis of microscopic images showed that CpG localized preferentially with DNA-PKcs in the cytosol in p110gamma -/ - cells to a greater extent than in wild-type cells .
We propose a novel regulatory role of p110gamma in CpG induced production of IL-10 through modulation of the intracellular trafficking of CpG .
Results
p110gamma deficiency specifically increased IL-10 production upon CpG stimulation in macrophages
Mouse macrophages generated IL-10 in response to CpG ( ) .
Since PI3K has been implicated in the regulation of TLR induced IL-10 production , we tested the effect of p110gamma depletion on IL-10 production .
CpG induced IL-10 production was dramatically increased in macrophages from p110gamma -/ - mouse ( ) .
Although IL-10 production sometimes varied extremely between experiments , IL-10 production in wild type mice was always approximately half of that in p110gamma -/ - mice in each paired experiment .
We also tested the cytokine production using macrophages from p85alpha -/ - mice , and from p110delta KD and KD mice ; neither displayed CpG specific changes in IL-10 production similar to what was seen with p110gamma -/ - cells ( data not shown ) .

The amount of IL-10 in the medium was determined by ELISA .
The values are the means + /- SD of duplicate cultures from three independent experiments .
Wortmannin inhibited IL-10 production induced by CpG , but increased that induced by LPS
Macrophages were treated with a pan-PI3K inhibitor , wortmannin .
CpG induced IL-10 production was almost completely inhibited by wortmannin while LPS induced IL-10 production was rather increased in wild type cells ( ) .
The effect of wortmannin on LPS induced IL-10 production may be the result of the inhibition of p110gamma , because the augmentation was not observed in p110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
However , wortmannin inhibited severely CpG induced IL-10 production in p110gamma -/ - cells , as well as in wild type cells ( .
D ) .
The inhibition by wortmannin was specific to IL-10 production , because IL-12 production was unchanged by the treatment ( data not shown ) .
These data indicate that the target molecule of wortmannin responsible for the suppression of CpG induced IL-10 was not p110gamma .

The amount of IL-10 in the medium was determined by ELISA .
The values are the means + /- SD of duplicate cultures from three independent experiments .
p110gamma mediated negative regulation of IL-10 production was independent of kinase activity
Since a pan-PI3K inhibitor , wortmannin , did not mimic the effect of p110gamma deficiency on CpG induced IL-10 production , we next tested the effect of the p110gamma specific inhibitor , AS252424 , on CpG induced IL-10 production .
C5a induced Akt phosphorylation was completely abolished in p110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
The result confirmed that the C5a action is dependent on p110gamma .
AS252424 inhibited the C5a induced Akt phosphorylation ( ) , indicating that the compound is a powerful tool for investigating the role of p110gamma .
Surprisingly , AS252424 did not cause an increase in CpG induced IL-10 production in the wild type cells nor in p110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
These data suggest that the negative regulation of CpG induced IL-10 production by p110gamma was not dependent on its kinase activity .

CpG induced IL-10 production was abolished in SCID mice
Recently , an indispensable role of DNA-PKcs in CpG induced IL-10 production has been reported .
Since DNA-PKcs has a PI3K like catalytic domain , the kinase activity is susceptible to wortmannin .
As reported earlier , CpG induced IL-10 production was defective in SCID mice ( ) .
Additionally , wortmannin inhibited significantly CpG induced IL-10 production in wild type , whereas it did not affect this process in SCID mice ( ) .
This result suggests that wortmannin suppressed CpG induced IL-10 production through inhibition of DNA-PKcs .
By contrast , LPS induced IL-10 production in SCID was identical to wild type with the same background mice ( ) .

The amount of IL-10 in the medium was determined by ELISA .
The values are the means + /- SD of duplicate cultures from three independent experiments .
Co-localization of DNA-PKcs and CpG was increased in p110gamma -/ - cells
CpG is internalized via endocytosis and immediately moves into the lysosomal compartment , , .
A recent study reported that endosomal CpG preferentially induces IL-12 production , but , when released from the endosome , it associates with DNA-PKcs in cytoplasm and induces a greater amount of IL-10 .
Therefore , we hypothesized that CpG localized to the endosomal compartment in the wild type cells , and was more efficiently released into the cytosol in p110gamma -/ - cells .
To quantify the co-localization of CpG and DNA-PKcs , macrophages were incubated with rhodamine labeled CpG , fixed with formaldehyde , permeabilized , and incubated with anti-DNA-PKcs antibody .
The merged area was calculated from the imaging data as described under .
The Co-localization area of CpG and DNA-PKcs was significantly increased in 110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
Interestingly , CpG complexed with cationic liposomes composed of Lipofectamine ( LTX ) and Plus reagent localized in large vesicles both in wild type and p110gamma -/ - cells , and scarcely co-localized with DNA-PKcs ( ) .
Since wortmannin did not affect CpG uptake or localization of CpG or DNA-PKcs ( data not shown ) , the PI3K inhibitor exclusively inhibits the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs .

Manipulation of CpG localization with cationic liposomes abolished the effect of p110gamma deficiency on cytokine production
It seemed interesting to determine IL-10 production by CpG complexed with the lipofection reagent , which hardly co-localizes with DNA-PKcs .
When cells were stimulated with this CpG and lipofection reagent , IL-10 production was decreased both in wild-type and p110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
In addition , the augmentation of IL-10 production seen in p110gamma -/ - cells was completely abolished using this delivery system ( ) .

The amount of IL-10 ( A ) and IL-12 ( B ) in the medium was determined by ELISA .
The values are the means + /- SD of duplicate cultures from three independent experiments .
CpG preferentially localized in the early endosome in wild type cells , and in lysosomes in p110gamma -/ - cells
We next tested the cellular delivery of CpG using an early endosome marker , EEA1 , an endosome marker , dextran , and an acidic lysosome marker , LysoTracker .
Quantitative analysis of microscopic images showed that more CpG merged with EEA1 and dextran in wild type cells than in p110gamma -/ - cells ( ) .
By contrast , CpG preferentially merged with LysoTracker in p110gamma -/ - cells more than in wild-type cells ( ) .
To further investigate the role of p110gamma in CpG localization , Cos7 cells were transfected with p110gamma and its mutant forms ( unlike macrophages , Cos7 cells do not express p110gamma ) .
As shown in , most of the CpG was co-localized with LysoTracker in Cos7 cells transfected with vehicle alone , while scarcely co-localized with LysoTracker in the cells transfected with wild type p110gamma .
Interestingly , overexpression of a kinase dead mutant of p110gamma also inhibited the acidification of CpG containing endosome .
By contrast , the Ras binding domain mutant form showed no effect on the CpG localization .
These results suggest that PI3K p110gamma play a role in endosomal acidification independent of its kinase activity .
Since endosomal acidification is known to precede the endosomal leakage , acidification of CpG containing endosome may accelerate CpG translocation to the cytosol and the resultant association with DNA-PKcs to increase IL-10 production in macrophages .

Discussion
In this study , we have identified a novel function of PI3K p110gamma in the regulation of CpG localization .
We have demonstrated this function using p110gamma -/ - macrophages and Cos7 cells transfected with p110gamma .
In macrophages , more CpG merged with the endosome markers , EEA1 and dextran , in wild type cells than in p110gamma -/ - cells , whereas preferentially merged with the acidic lysosome marker , LysoTracker , in p110gamma -/ - cells to a greater extent than in wild-type cells .
In Cos7 cells , which do not express p110gamma , most of the CpG was co-localized with LysoTracker , and scarcely co-localized with the dye in the cells transfected with p110gamma .
Another novel finding reported in this paper is that IL-10 production was increased specifically in p110gamma -/ - cells following CpG stimulation .
In p110gamma -/ - cells , the increased acidification of CpG containing endosomes and the resultant leakage of CpG to the cytosol , where DNA-PKcs resides , appears to be responsible for the modulation of cytokine production .
For this reason , CpG induced , but not LPS induced , IL-10 production was almost completely abolished in SCID mice having mutations in DNA-PKcs .
Furthermore , wortmannin , an inhibitor of DNA-PKcs , inhibited completely CpG induced IL-10 production both in wild-type and in p110gamma -/ - cells .
In addition to these , manipulation of the delivery system with cationic liposomes , which severely blocked the cytosolic delivery of CpG both in p110gamma -/ - and wild type cells , resulted in decreased IL-10 production .
Finally , an intriguing point in this study is that the actions of p110gamma on both the CpG delivery system and cytokine production were independent of its kinase activity .
Several kinase independent functions of p110gamma have been reported previously .
Protein complexes containing p110gamma are known to activate phosphodiesterase ( PDE3B ) in cardiomyocytes to degrade cAMP in a manner independent of its kinase activity , .
Since increases in the cAMP level results in augmentation of TLR mediated IL-12 production , with a decrease in IL-10 production , we had hypothesized that the increased IL-10 production in the absence of p110gamma might be the result of elevated cAMP levels .
To answer this question we tested some reagents known to increase cAMP , such as forskolin , prostaglandin E 2 , 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin or dibutyryl cAMP in IL-10 production .
Although these reagents more or less enhanced IL-10 production , the effect was not specific to CpG stimulation , but rather , was commonly observed in TLR stimulation ( data not shown ) .
The other kinase independent functions of p110gamma are reported in vascular repair and platelet aggregation .
In addition , wild-type or the kinase dead mutant of p110gamma can block the growth of human colon cancer cells .
Although the mechanism of these kinase independent actions of p110gamma remains to be clarified , a scaffolding role for p110gamma has been suggested .
p110gamma -/ - mice show severe defects in immune responses , and are protected completely against systemic anaphylaxis -.
Additionally , in models of rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , and atherosclerosis , loss of p110gamma activity results in protection against disease progression -.
Since IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine , the increased IL-10 production in p110gamma deficient cells may contribute , at least in a part , to protection against excessive inflammation .
It is also likely that the increased IL-10 and decreased IL-12 production in p110gamma -/ - macrophage might explain partly the development of colorectal carcinomas in p110gamma -/ - mice , because the IL-12-mediated Th1 response favors effective anti-tumor immune responses .
Although further studies are needed to confirm the in vivo effect of p110gamma on the translocation of CpG , our findings suggest that when p110gamma is considered as a drug target for immune diseases , , , not only its lipid kinase function , but also its kinase independent function should be considered .
